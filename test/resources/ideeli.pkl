VI ordered a Wall Mural from Ideeli.  Instead of the mural, they sent me a different product that was stickered as my item.  When I contacted Ideeli, they admitted the mixup and offered to put me on the waitlist for the item I ordered and paid for in good faith.  That would be fine, except that I get the same notice of availability as someone who may have waitlisted long after I had already paid for the item.  They will also keep my money until they receive the mistaken item back.  They did offer a prepaid shipping label but made it seem like they were doing me a favor in doing so.  They gave me a $10 voucher but I really would prefer that they fix their mistake!

VI purchased an e-gift card that was supposed to be delivered on Christmas Day. It's now the 28th. Still no confirmation email, and I can't even check my last order. Forget getting customer service. It is either a chat line or an email to which they will promptly "log your complaints in" and get nothing done. STAY AWAY!!!

VOrdered an item on 11/23 for my daughters birthday on 12/16.  Was told it would ship 12/5.  On 12/10 I went online to find out.  They claimed they shipped and it was delivered on 12/5 which it was not.  They never sent a shipping notice so I had no idea!.  Cant get through on the phone and "live chat" tells me we will get back to you.  They did not.  Live chat again tells me they are 'investigating" and I have to wait 8 days for an answer !  what bull$#*! !! Never order from there again !

VI used to be their customer for three years. Two years ago I ordered a pair of pants and aftre I got different pants that the one I ordered I decided to take a brake from ideeli, but recently I ordered from them again. On the begining of november I ordered an item, I got an email that item was shipped but my truking number doesnt work. I called ups I was to usps and nothing nobody can't tell me where my order is. I contact ideeli x times. Everytime they tell me different stories. To wait 1-2 business days, then they told me they can't find my order and they will return my money , then they never returned my money and when I contact them to ask why a they say to wait 8-10 more days because item my be on it's way. I have no more patiency  for that. They are not profesionall at all, and don't give a $#*! about their customers. At their customer service all people lie to you. They tell you different stories and when you ask why your coworker gave me another info they say don't believe him but believe me. It's insane, I will never buy anything from them again. At this point I will probably never see my money nor my item, but people if you care about your money don't buy from ideeli.com.

Vi'm super disappointed with ideeli they're very unprofessional, it is frustrating to get my orders they take too long to ship and i thought it's maybe because i live in Hawaii but i spend over $4000 since i have been a member with them but on my last order i have spent about over $200 and it took about a month and when i received my order it wasn't even what i've ordered. they mixed up my order with somebody's stuff and when i told them about it they told me to wait 24 hours so they can get back to me but i never heard from them back. it's frustrating i will never shop there again. i just want to say don't waste your money with them.

VBuyer beware. I purchased a travel voucher for $2200 and was unable to travel during the time period due to family medical reasons. When I contacted ideeli they stated they were no longer doing business with the 3rd party travel agency and since they paid them. They were unable to give me a credit!!! I wasn't asking for a refund just a credit. Customer service said there was nothing they could do except offer me a $25 credit which was insulting. I was a loyal customer who spent thousands of dollars but that does not matter to this company. Imagine losing $2200 dollars and see if you'd ever shop here again. If anyone is interested in a class action law suit please contact me if you've had similar experiences. Groupon lost a multi-million dollar lawsuit and now their groupons will retain cash value even if expired. Again I would not recommend ideeli to anyone.

VThis site nickels and dimes you. It costs $10 to ship something, and if you decide you want to return it, it's another $9. Most of the products are absolute crap. I tried using them twice, both times I had items shipped to me that were defective. I would strongly suggest shopping at another discount online store- because they are plentiful and are typically much cheaper/better quality.

VStay away. I seriously hope they go out of business. I wonder how they can even survive in this competitive market. It usually takes about 3 weeks to receive items. \u000aMy previous order, which was missing for some reason, arrived at my place after two months. And this last order, which was ordered for my mom, was supposed to be shipped on 10/29 or 10/30, and all of a sudden, the shipment is pending. The customer service representative responded as if it's not their problem, it's more like the manufacturer's problem. And that's the reason why ideeli is able to offer products at such a low price. F--- you. Never going to come back this website ever again in my life.

VI had posted in the past about an issue with Ideeli. Guess what, I have a similar problem, AGAIN! I ordered a suitcase, did not arrive for 4 months, contacted customer service to find out what's going on. They said they were out of stock, couldn't tell me that for 4 months, could they??? The usual, we will credit your account with $10 bullcrap. I check the website later and find out the bag is in stock again, so I contacted the customer service again. This time they forward me a link to the bag and ask me to reorder it, but the price is almost double the one that I originally ordered at. Nice way to rip off the customer. \u000a\u000aPrevious review :[I ordered a pair of shoes, the order got cancelled saying that there was an issue with credit card whereas my credit card has been working fine with every other transaction I have made. Then there was this second time when they said there was an inventory problem and the order for a dress got cancelled. I contacted the customer service and the guy was rude. Initially I was a bit heated up and did not engage in common courtesy but I was t quick to apologize. That did not help. Then he went ahead and the wisecrack that he was, he told me how he would just go out and buy a dress if he were me, like I did not think of that.]

VTwo of my last few orders - received wrong merchandise. Ideeli does not have a telephone number on their site, you need to Google for it. Then try getting through to a human -- impossible. Had to contact my credit card company to dispute the charge and make sure I was not charged their exorbitant return shipping fees as this was their mistake. Learned from my credit card company that Ideeli never bothered to refund me for the last item I returned and had I not had a new problem, I probably wouldn't have realized it. Also placed an order with them several months ago that remained an open order waiting for them to receive the merchandise. They never once contacted me to tell me there was a delay and ultimately they closed the order without even letting me know. The only reason I got a response from anyone at Ideeli is because I posted on their Facebook page and I was among many with issues. I have removed myself from their mailing list. Their quality control is horrible and customer service horrific.

VI have shopped from Ideeli in the past and had a decent experience.  However, I recently order 2 suits from Ideeli.  One suit was shipped with the jacket only - no skirt.  There is no phone # to be found on the website or the web in general.  I went onto their chat 4 times and was told I was #1 in the queue but no one ever responds.  I sent 2 emails from 2 different email accounts.  They did respond to the gmail account and I was told they would look into it and get back to me by 8:00 the next day.  Still waiting to get a reply.  They have the absolute worst customer service.  I can only hope to cancel my credit card charge since they don't seem to care about fixing a problem.

VI have been ordering from ideeli for over 3 years and just over a year ago my orders have started to get mixed up or items missing from the order. I placed two different orders within the last month and both have been really messed up. The first order was missing a dress and the second order for two pair of shoes came with one pair and a purse in a shoe box. \u000aEach time that I contact their customer service I receive the same response. The item is no longer available and we will give you a store credit of $25. When I shop, I shop for items that will compliment other items I already own. It really angers me when I'm expecting an item and I don't get it.  I did my part, but ideeli has issues with providing follow through. \u000aUnfortunately, I have referred friends and coworkers to this site.  I can view those invitations and warn others of how careless this company is with providing correct orders to customers but they always get their money and offer store credit. \u000a\u000aBe warned! Any company that does NOT provide a phone number for customer service or calls you from a blocked number is definitely trying to hide something!

VI finally stopped shopping from them.  Initially, they weren't so bad but over the past year, every item I have bought from them has been defective.  I bought a watch in Dec 2012 that stopped working by March.  I recently had the time to take it in, thinking it was the battery to find out it is completely broken and it would cost me more than the price of the watch to get it fixed. Every single item I've bought from them has ended up falling apart in no time -- a complete waste of money.

I took it to the Valentino store and they confirmed it was NOT an authentic Valentino bag.  I'm not sure how they can get away with selling fake bags when I paid almost $500 for this item.\u000a\u000aSecond - I should have learned from my first experience, but I bought a jacket and a few other items from them.  They lost the package.  Somehow they don't require a signature on the package and the package was claimed to be delivered.  It was never delivered, as my doorman can vouch for that.  They log every package that comes into the building and this package from ideeli never came.  \u000a\u000aIdeeli seemed like a great website, but unfortunatey I would stay away.

VI have not used ideeli for over a year because of my disappointment with my last order where every single piece I ordered was defective (shoes were smaller than the stated size, skirt had a button missing, and the handbag had creases on it which are still there a year later). However, as I was in the middle of the move, I didn't have time to return them.\u000a\u000aThe items that I had ordered before that were also defective and I ended up returning them. I still have balance in my account in Ideeli from that transaction and I was thinking of closing my account and getting my money back. When I checked my account, I realized that the amount that's showing up in my account looks  less than what I was expecting. I send them an email asking if there is a chance that they deducted the money from my account because of inactivity, which would be unethical if they did without my knowledge. I also requested them to close my account and return my money ($140). It took two more emails to finally a get a response, which was "canned" and did not answer my first question.\u000a\u000aBut here is something they said about returning my money which blew my mind. "It has been over a year that the credit was processed under your account.  Unfortunately, we no longer use the system we had a year ago to refund the credits back to your credit card. " What kind of unethical business refuses to credit customers their money because of their own business practices. I am furious and just want them to  return my money as well as provide an account of my money so i know why they deducted money from my balance without my knowledge.\u000a\u000aI am giving them a chance to resolve this or I will have to share this story on social media sites. [Incident: 130913-000010]\u000a\u000aAn update: They continue to refuse to credit my amount. Here is their response, "Due to the extended period of time in which you received the credit, we're no longer able to issue these credits to you in the form of cash, as they do not exist in that fashion. "\u000a\u000aBasically, the money that I have in Ideeli account as credit will not be refunded to me. I am being forced to spend my hard earned money buying their low quality items. Of note, they still haven't provided me with a statement about the money in my account to explain the remaining balance.

VI have been buying from ideeli for several years. Two years ago I had a bad customer service experience when they sent me only one item instead of two, and did not want to compensate me for a missing item. But I let it go. Boy was I wrong. In the last month  ideeli managed to screw up 2 of my orders: one item was of different size than what I ordered, and other one was different color.  I have had enough. It would still be fine if they were prompt responding to my issue, but I have been waiting for 2 days for them to reply to me!! They did send me a confirmation that they received my question, saying they they "pledge to respond within 24 hours". What a joke! Please don't bother ordering from ideeli when there are so many website with really excellent customer service, such as myhabit or zulily.

VI'm very disappointed with ideeli customer service. As their newly registered customer, I didn't expect that my membership would be associated with such awfull shopping experience.\u000aOn August 9 I placed my first ideeli order #65231434. It was successfully confirmed and the shipping data was indicated as August 12-13. On August 13 I contacted ideeli customer service with a rightful question about the shipment pending. I was told that "the order is now send to the warehouse and preparing for shipment. The order will be ship shortly".\u000aNext day I had to contacted ideeli customer support again with the same question about the reason of the shipping delay and got the answer that "the item is in our warehouse but is in pending fulfillment" because "we have recently changed our warehouse and due to that some items will be shipped delay".\u000aThen I contacted ideeli support again and was told that "the order is preparing for shipment". I haven't received any email notification about this delay and any reasons of that and was very upset that a birthday gift that I purchased for my Mother would come too late.\u000aI thought that the words "the order is preparing for shipment" did really mean that I was going to get it, that the item was REALLY going to be shipped. How could I know that ideeli representatives lie to their customers???\u000aNothing changed next two days and on August 16 I had to write them again. Ideeli representative called Tajuana wrote only that "we are unable to guarantee exact date of shipping" and "this kind of thing unfortunately happens from time to time", that was her explanation in turn to my question about the reason of the delay! I had to ask her twice before she checked the information and said finally that "the initial shipment did not past quality control so we are trying to get another from the manufacturer who is experiencing a delay". Moreover, she added that "at this moment, we do not have an updated ship date" and that "if the manufacturer informs us that they can no longer send us the item, the order will be cancelled"!!! Surprise!!!!\u000aAnyway, I was told to wait and contact them in a week if the item is not shipped earlier. On August 23 I wrote them again because nothing changed. Representatives called Malou and Lia didn't help. I had to spoke with their supervisor Lulu and she said that "there are some delays because of the switching to the new warehouse...". When I asked her about the quality issue she answered that everything was fine with the item. She said contact them in 3-4 days if they would not ship the item earlier. Today is August 29, I contacted Tajuana through the live chat and got the previous version about the manufacturer again!!!! It is absolutely ridiculous!!! I have contacted ideeli customer service for more than 14 times (!!!) and all  representatives are not able to answer two simple questions: what is the reason of this delay and when exactly I will receive my order? Ideeli agents keep on telling me that the item IS in their warehouse, that my order has been processed and is ready to be shipped, so I really don't understand what is the problem with the shipping? Then I get another reason of the delay, then another one. Then the initial version. I'm convinced that some of they (particularly Tajuana) are simply lying to me and just don't want to do they job properly because I really don't understand how it could be that the order is ready to be shipped but for some reason they cannot ship it. What is the reason of that??? At first I was told that they were experiencing some problems with switching to their new warehouse, later I was told that SURPRISE! the item was defective and they had to order another one from the manufacturer, on August 23 there was the previous version again - the item is ready for shipping. Today I was told about it is the manufacturer fault again. So what should I think? Once again, I think that they lie. And I want to know why, why I cannot get my order finally and why I have to experience such devil-may-care attitude, carelessness, ignorance and unprofessionalism from this company? All that I want - is my order. I'm their new customer, I registered 20 days ago hoping that I could get a nice gift for my mother's birthday! And what do I have now? Nothing! Neither my order, nor any proper assistance from them. I want to be sure that my order won't be canceled, but now I'm not sure! I want to get my item but they even cannot say if I receive it or not! I want to know the reason of this huge delay and they are not able to tell me the truth keeping misinforming me!!! How can I trust ideeli and be their loyal customer, making another purchases if I can't be sure that the situation won't happened again?\u000aI'm a journalist and a reputable member of russian online shopping community and I will definitely make a post with a detailed description of this ridiculous situation, so that everybody will be warned not for any reason having a deal with ideeli.\u000a\u000aAll that I want are my order #65231434 shipped to me, attentive, professional attitude and truth.

VHorrible experience! Where do I begin..it was my first time shopping with ideeli so I made sure everything was returnable, once purchased on my confirmation email it stated 2 of the items were nonreturnable and on the printed packaging slip once my items were delivered it stated all 3 were no returnable. Ideeli took care if it and I was able to return all 3. Ideeli's return policy states 2-4 days once they receive your return for it to be processed and for you to receive your refund. Reached out to them on the 5th business day once I still hadn't received my refund, they told me to check back the next day. Checked back and they now told me it would take 5-8 days to receive my refund. On the 7th day after continuously contacting them i finally received a notification that my return was being processed and it would take 3-5 days to see the credit returned to my account. We are now looking at 10-16 business days vs the 2-4 to receive a $100+ refund. Unacceptable. They don't adhere to their written terms.

I told them that I would file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (which I did) and due directly to that comment they froze the account rather than helping a customer.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, after mentioning the poor service on Facebook - they blocked me from their page.  This could have been avoided by being responsive to their customers.  While I miss their awesome dresses, I certainly don't miss them.

NO customer support! - NONE - when you contact them - nothing is ever resolved!! they are NOT attentive to your questions and never resolve anything.  PLUS it takes days to hear back - and honestly - it's soooooo frustrating that you will just want to give up and let it go....\u000a5. NO customer service again - when they do contact you - they are not friendly, they are not trained to revolve issues - and it's even more frustrasting.\u000a5. pricing - honestly, it's not that great if you know about ruelala, century21 and tjmaxx - ideeli pricing isn't that great BUT the amount of frustrating is high.. i say it's not worth it.\u000a6. cannot wait to use up my balance and close that account!

VLast month, I ordered a pair of shoes and paid the crazy $9.95 shipping charge, which gives you shipping for 30 days after the purchase.  The shoes arrived after about 3 weeks and I loved them.  During the 30 days I kept my eye out for something else I might like and found another pair of shoes that I wanted to buy.  I tried to buy them and immediately they were on hold, then no longer available.  So, I added my name to the wait list.  Shortly after my 30 days of free shipping expired, I received notification that they were available.  Interesting... I decided not to buy them because I'd have to pay another $9.95 in shipping on a $19.99 pair of shoes.  The next day they sent me a coupon for $10 off, so I ordered the shoes.  When they were arrived, they were a wreck!  One shoe had several rhinestones missing and the other was very clearly manufactured incorrectly.  I sent an email to customer service which included a photo of the defects.  Their response, sorry, throw away the shoes and here's your $9.99 back.  Result for me?  I paid a net of $9.95 and got NOTHING.  So, I now believe their way of making money is actually through the shipping, not through the trash they "sell."  I have never run into an online retailer that expects you to pay shipping on defective merchandise.  I've made my last purchase.  I will be unsubscribing and never looking back.  BUYER BEWARE!

VI have been a long term customer of ideeli but recently they have changed their policy in regards to purchasing.  I purchased an order for $106 but my card was charged an additional $167.  Customer services informed me that it was their policy to do "test holds" to make sure customers are using current credit cards.  And by the way it's up to the customer's bank to determine when these holds would credited back to your account but it may take days to come off.\u000a\u000aI suggest a new solution.

VI used to be an avid Ideeli shopper.  I loved all the sales they had and they have great deals.  HOWEVER, they used to be soooo accomodating!!  A few years ago, I bought a pair of shoes, they didn't fit and they gave me a credit right then to re-buy them so they wouldn't sell out.  I returned them the next day via UPS no problem and had my new shoes that fit!  Fast forward to literally a few minutes ago and the same thing happened, and I was told that not only can I NOT do that, but they wouldn't even apply my credit for my returned jacket unless the return made it to their wearhouse before they shipped out the new jacket.  This was frustrating especially because they can see where your package is (so they know it will be there in THREE days) and could easily prove it was on the way.  Not only that, but worst case, if it didn't meet their return standards or they didn't receive the jacket, they could just charge me for the jacket I exchanged it for.  It's not like they don't have my credit card on file!!!  \u000a\u000aAnyway, after "Glen" told me he'd issue me a $10 credit to use today, I asked him if I could change my store credit return for the jacket I'd just shipped back to a refund.  That $10 would cover the $8 they charge you to refund your card, so it'd balance out.  Then he told me he had to escalate it to returns and I wouldn't know if I could change that until tomorrow.  But the $10 is only good for today.  So really, if they decide not to honor my request, I've spent $90 on a jacket I was planning on paying $50 for.  And I don't want to have even more money out on that site.  So, I left hating Ideeli and not even wanting the damn jacket. Thanks Ideeli for screwing up my Saturday morning!

VTheir service's getting down recently. I'd got $15 credit from their promotion and decided buying something. At starting shipment 9.95$, I asked my friend to share the order. We placed 2 items payment: a 20" spinner and a belt. Money processed. \u000aAfter 5 days, they asked for Card authorization for the First item to be shipped: the belt. Done. 27 days later, they auto-processed another amount on my CC for 2nd item ( the 20" spinner) but ....shipping pending. As many discussing mails were sent to & back, they admitted of that item was no longer available, so they would make up for the inconvenience by crediting my account with $10.\u000aProblem now is, after one month of 1st item shipped, money had been captured, included of full price payment plus $9.95 shipping, couldn't been partly released. In a dozen email I asked them to refund me $15 promoted credit into my account. They at last give me credit $15, but then cut off the 10$ convenience upwards !!!\u000aI'm not in US, my CC issued bank system just release unclear fund after 33-40 days. The initial placed order amount $119.93 had just been back to my bank account 3 days ago (after 37days). Until today I've received a belt (of my friend) at 19.94$, but my bank account still was minus $119.93. Yesterday, Ideeli sent me void receipt of $87.99. And I have to  ask and insist them to return me $15 from bank credit to website credit. It's so humor, isn't it?  I have the feeling like being stolen & cheated

VI used to love their merchandise.  Unfortunately they are a terrible company, that forcibly closed my account over a mere $10 courtesy when they lost multiple items in the mail.  They treated me horribly and when I mentioned the Better Business Bureau, they forcibly closed my account.\u000a\u000aAfter complaining, Ideeli refused to allow me to return items that were in the mail at the time of the complaint.\u000a\u000aIt was a measly $50 return, and after buying all of my bridesmaid dresses through the company, they tossed years of loyalty to the curb.\u000a\u000aThey claimed that the BBB sided with them, but rather they informed me that "they "are not an enforcement agency and we cannot compel a business to settle your complaint"\u000a\u000aIn other words, they choose to act as a neglectful, horrible company that doesn't care about its customers.  Run as far as you can from them!

VI have NEVER had such a TERRIBLE experience as I have had with ideeli.com. I had ordered a dress originally with no problem, but my second round of ordering was a debacle. I ordered a black leather toiletry bag with a purple interior. They sent me a purple leather toiletry bag with a tan interior, and it had a manufacturing defect to boot. That bag was NEVER even displayed on their website. I doubted that the bag I truly wanted was even in their stock. I contacted CS to see what was going on and they apologized and said I was in luck! I could send back the wrong bag and re-purchase the correct one, with a one-time-use-only link. But I didn't want to repurchase it, I wanted to exchange it, and they charged me EXTRA SHIPPING to BUY IT AGAIN, since by the time of my reorder, my previous free month of shipping had expired. So I had to pay $9.99 extra because they made a mistake! \u000a\u000aNot only that, but my order was subsequently CANCELED due to FRAUD investigations, which I was upset by - I shouldn't even have had to place a reorder, let alone be charged with fraud for placing it. It turns out that because my boyfriend, who I had invited to ideeli.com, used my credit card when placing an order of his (he is in the process of moving and switching bank accounts and is without a card for the next couple of weeks), ideeli thought that I was trying to scam them for $25. So what if my boyfriend likes to have his own account to shop on? Or is moving and needs to borrow a credit card from a friend to shop online? I don't really care. But ideeli does! But do they even offer a place for you to enter the name under which your account is held, independently of an order? No. They assume that if the same billing address is used on any purchase, you are the same person with multiple accounts and you are trying to scam them for a petty $25. So now they have "suspended" both of our accounts AND canceled the replacement of the bag I re-ordered (at a higher price, with the renewed shipping charge). When I told them what happened and asked them to PLEASE provide some timely customer service (every inquiry I made, via chat or e-mail took at least a day to respond to - you can't get them on the phone), they told me that I HAVE to pay the new shipping charge if I want to re-order that bag, because of their shipping mistake - they refuse to consider this the order I placed two weeks ago. Also they will not recredit my account the $25.00 I had received from inviting my boyfriend, who made HIS OWN PURCHASES on the website. \u000a\u000aI have NEVER been SO DISGUSTED with any customer service or any website I have purchased from. I will never buy anything from them again!

VIdeeli has the worst customer service reps.\u000aI wanted to return 2 boots that I bought because they were defected.\u000aSo I used the chatting service to see if I can return them and they said yes. The only thing is that, they sent me a UPS lable that said 2 lbs for 2 boots. UPS said that the box weight exceeds the amount on the return label. so I chatted with the customer service rep who was so rude. He or she was like No way our return label should work bla bla bla.\u000aThen they said we will escalate this matter  and left the chat.\u000aI was pretty upset.  I chatted with another customer rep who did the same thing. I was not getting the help I needed. Basically they didn't want to print out the correct label for me so I can return it..\u000aWorst customer service ever compare to Haute look, gilt and Ruelala.

VWhat a mess. I'm waiting for a prepaid return label and a full credit to my credit card and then I will cut off all association with this company.\u000a\u000aI ordered a quilt and shams - $175 purchase. Waited and waited for the shipment information and finally got an apology email that the item was unavailable. Assured me I had not been billed and gave me a $10 credit for shipping on my next order. \u000a\u000aThen, got an email that the item I had ordered had become available and that I could place another order, which I did.\u000a\u000aWaited and waited for delivery information. Finally got that email and saw the charge come through on my credit card. Checked the tracking detail and saw a message that shipments had been delayed due to the situation in Boston (the marathon bombing). Waited for more information. \u000a\u000aFinally got a package in my mailbox in a plastic mailer. NOT a king size quilt and shams. Instead a "table runner" in an altogether different pattern even.\u000a\u000aI have just spent e chat time with Marie Rose who disconnected me after I expressed that I was going to post on YELP. This site is even better than that. \u000a\u000aHer position is that she will not refund my charge card, even though she tells me the item is sold out and never could have been delivered, until I return the item I never ordered - probably worth 20 bucks at most. I have still not received the email with the prepaid shipping label so I can send you your precious little scrap of fabric and get the $175 charge reversed. \u000a\u000aThis has been a sloppy transaction with crappy service all the way from the beginning to the hopefully soon end.

VI ordered a pair of LAMB shoes for just under $175, a good price.  They were delayed in getting to me and subsequently was out of town when they arrived.  When I opened the box they did not match the quality I expected.  I compared them to several pairs I own that I paid full retail on and they were not even close.  They represented them to be authentic, impossible.  By the time I opened everything, the 14 day return period passed.  I will never purchase from ideeli again.

Such a waste of time and money. Lucky me. I get two wait 48 hours for a return label.  Then trek to post office to return something that is not at all what I ordered and then wait for a refund less whatever ridiculous deductions they have the nerve to charge.

VI have ordered from ideeli before, but I will NEVER order from them again. I ordered a pair of heels from them on February 21 to match a dress that I was going to wear for my birthday party on March 30. I ordered them over a month in advance to make sure that if I change my mind, I can always buy a new outfit and have plenty of time. First, they sent my order to the WRONG ADDRESS which caused a return to sender, since the address they mailed it to was incorrect. They tried to blame it on UPS/USPS, but why would it be an undeliverable address if the correct address was printed on the label??? So I chat with a rep (BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CALL AND SPEAK WITH ANYONE) and they tell me I have to wait until they receive the package and they will mail it back out. They mail it again and I finally receive it yesterday 3/28 (a month and a week after I ordered) AND THEY SENT ME 2 DIFFERENT SHOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As in, 1 turquoise shoe and 1 nude shoe...not the wrong size or a small mistake like that but 2 different COLORED shoes. Is it that hard to make sure you have a complete order before shipping your products out? I'm now beyond pissed and have to purchase a new dress and shoes before my birthday party tomorrow. Thanks for ruining my 25th birthday ideeli!

VI have bought several items from ideeli.com, and I've come to notice that the prices for these things are nothing special. That is to say, a matching or lower price can be easily found through simple google search. What prompted me to write this review was  my latest purchase of sunglasses, supposedly made in Italy but they looked more like they were made in China - the overall quality was severely lacking. And for this I paid double the price I could have paid had I searched google for the same "Italian" glasses. What makes me furious is that they decided to make this purchase non-returnable.

VIdeeli customer service is the worst customer service I have ever experienced! I never take the time to write reviews, but I am so dissapointed that I wanted to take the time to do so. \u000aI ordered champagne glasses and they did not provide any protective packaging and they broke. I contacted them and they said I would either have to send it back or they would provide me a $5 credit for the one broken glass. I live in NYC and it is difficult to get to a post office (no car/far from apt/open during work hours only) so I opted for the credit. I now have only 3 champagne glasses.\u000aWith that, I still decided to order again and ordered a plastic makeup organizer. The plastic organizer was also packaged with no protection. It arrived broken as well. I contacted Ideeli once again. They said in order to receive a refund, I would have to ship it back. What a hassle... again! I informed them that would be quite inconvenient for me and asked if I could send a picture and show them it was broken in order to receive a credit. They said they only honor pictures when it is a breakable item made of ceramic or glass. They said there was nothing else they would do for me and thanked me for understanding. \u000aMy view is that I should not have to be inconvenienced everytime I use their site if I want to receive an order that is not broken. \u000aAlso- in regards to their deals on designer items: Before you purchase, do a quick google search for the same item. You may find that somewhere else is selling it for the same or lower price. Also, the "original price" they display is FAR from the original price.\u000aDO NOT USE THIS SITE. Use Ruelala or Gilt instead. For home goods, try Jossandmain.com. Their customer service is impeccable!

VI generally frequent sites similar to Ideeli, like Gilt and Hautelook, and expected similar customer service from Ideeli.  Boy, was I wrong.  I purchased something from Ideeli in late November...I still have not received the item.  Ideeli ships their product via UPS Surepost, which the only thing "sure" about it is that it's sure to be late.  UPS will transport the item up to a point, then transfer to it USPS.  There's no tracking available of your product after that point.  My stuff shipped on 12/18 and it's now 1/8 and I've still not received it.  Worst procurement process ever.

I called them immediately and explained that Bank of America charges $35 if at midnight your account is overdrawn. No response. I used their live chat and finally got someone to call me. They said this is a reoccurring problem they've had with customers, and refused to take any accountability. They apologized repeatedly, but refused to cover the bank fee THEY had racked up. They also claimed they had voided all of the extra charges, that they would drop off at the banks discretion. The banks discretion is 3-5 business days, well past the deadline for my fee.\u000a\u000aI've been a customer of theirs for the last year and a half and could not believe this treatment. It's unacceptable to charge more than the purchase price, especially in multiple increments. They claimed to authorize the card for the whole amount, void the charge, them charge as the items ship. WHY NOT CHARGE THE PRICE OUTRIGHT.? OR HAVE THIS RIDICULOUS POLICY POSTED? \u000a\u000aI canceled my account with them on the spot. Literally the worst customer service I have ever had to endure!!!

VAbsolutely sucks! \u000aI bought three dresses on Ideeli more than a month ago and decided to return all three of them because none of them fit. After a few days, I received an email saying that they received two items and issued me refund for those two items. I was very confused because I sent back all three items in one single package but they said they only received two. So I contacted customer service and the representative told me that they DID receive that third item and will be issuing the ADDITIONAL refund within 7-10 days. Then more than a week passed and I didn't hear anything back from them. So I contacted customer service again and this time they told me they never received the third item. After that we had more than 10 email conversations back and forth discussing how the customer service can tell the customer that they received it at first and then tell the customer that they never received it. All I got was the same answer (that sounds like a copied and pasted one) where they said sorry blah blah blah and we will talk to UPS about this issue. So what am I supposed to do??? Just wait here and let them say whatever they want to say??? If Ideeli was the party that lost my item, I have no right to complain/get my refund back but to let them take the money away from me??? I have wasted so much time and energy on this. And I swear I will never purchase on Ideeli EVER AGAIN!

She offered to submit my concern for investigation, but apparently could not do anything else for me.  When I explained that I would prefer to have the problem fixed immediately so I could make another purchase, she stated that I should hold off on any purchases because "we don't want another problem, do we?"  After my concern was investigated, I received an email assuring that my credit card would be refunded.  After a month and no refund, I contacted customer service again and dealt with another rude customer service representative who finally figured out what was going on, stated he would have the refund reissued, and then hung up on me.

Completely wrong item\u000a\u000aThey keep getting slower in their customer service request responses. The "will resolve in 3-5 days" is untrue.

This can result in a longer wait time than you may be accustomed to, but it also ensures a high degree of quality control, guaranteed authenticity, and those great prices.\u000a\u000a Jessica: We always offer an expected shipping date so that our customers know if the items meet their needs\u000a liza : but a month later?\u000a Jessica: Yes because we don't keep inventory\u000a liza : why do i have to wait a whole month after i purchased the item? \u000a Jessica: That is when the vendor has promised to have the item to us\u000a liza : you gave me a expected ship date of August 30- Sep 6\u000a liza : why not advertise the item when you do have the item?\u000a Jessica: I'm not sure I follow\u000a liza : Is this how ideeli works normally? \u000a Jessica: are you getting two expected shipping windows?\u000a Jessica: May I please have your order number to look into this? \u000a liza : ********\u000a Jessica: Thanks! Just one moment while I check that. \u000aJessica: Right this item should be shipping anytime now\u000a Jessica: It doesn't mean it will ship on the 30th\u000a Jessica: It can ship anytime within that window\u000a liza : so in order to buy from ideeli, i have to wait an entire month and pay for shipping \u000a Jessica: Not always\u000a Jessica: All vendors have different expected shipping windows\u000a liza : but sometime\u000a Jessica: Sure\u000a liza : May i cancel this item?\u000a Jessica: But as I said, it is part of the reason we can offer such reasonable prices is because we don\u2019t keep any inventory. \u000a Jessica: Sure\u000a Jessica: Please note that you were not charged\u000a liza : oh i know\u000a Jessica: Since we don't charge for items until then ship\u000a Jessica: *they\u000a Jessica: This order is now cancelled\u000a Jessica: You will receive confirmation shortly\u000a liza : wait?\u000a liza : I never said i wanted to cancel. I just asked if i could\u000a liza : as an option? \u000a Jessica: I am so sorry\u000a Jessica: I thought you wanted to cancel so the order is canceled \u000a liza : now what?\u000a Jessica: I am very sorry \u000a liza : so I can not get the item?\u000a liza : can you void that? \u000a Jessica: I can add you to the wait list for this item and apply a$15 voucher to your account as an apology\u000a Jessica: Once an order is canceled it isn't reversable\u000a Jessica: I'm terribly sorry about this miscommunication\u000a liza : Is there a manager? I ordered this as a gift for my mother\u000a Jessica: Yes I can have a manager contact you\u000a liza : she is expecting this at her address?\u000a Jessica: May I have a phone number where to reach you?\u000a liza : I would like that\u000a liza : ***************\u000a Jessica: Thank you.

VI used to shop at Ideeli religiously. They do have beautiful clothing and great deals, but like many reviewers before me I have had a problem with sizing and customer service. \u000aI purchased two bra and panty sets last year (totaling about $101 total). When UPS dropped it off, they left it on my front step rather than my apartment office. Both were stolen. When I contacted Ideeli about this issue they told me there would be an investigation and my money would be returned if they were stolen. Although I attempted to contact them later, I got no response. The same thing happened when I ordered from Ruelala and they credited my account for the loss within 48 hours. I will not ever order from Ideeli again no matter how good the sales are.\u000a\u000a***********Update!***************\u000aIt has been over a year since wrote this review and NOTHING came of it. The guy commenting on everyone's complaints said that he would "look into my situation" and never got back to me. I just downgraded my review from 2 to 1 star.

VDear JASON FARIA:\u000a\u000aI'm trying to reach out to you to give ideeli.com one more and last chance. I purchased two men shirts on Saturday July 14th. Even though it was supposed to be a surprise, I told my husband I had bought these items for him to make sure about the size. He told me I should have ordered size M, not L. I waited until Monday 16th to contact customer rep. The order is still expected to be shipped July 16-18, but I have been told right away that it is too late for a change in size. I hope you can do something more efficient about it. I don't want to deal with the hassle of returning it, but more importantly, I don't want to pay extra $10 for shipping. Actually, since none of the items I have ordered at ideeli.com fit me well after all and are sitting in my closet, I'm ready to switch to any of your competitors. Order Number: 47796118   \u000aThanks

VIdeeli what a scam..... they charge you $9.95 to ship and then if you want to return to your card they charge you a return service fee of $7.95.  I bought 2 pairs of shoes and returned them (shoes were below par of what they were described as), but was out $17.80 for nothing.  Live Chat was like texting to an automated system.  After cancelling my membership (exclusive ha ha) they did refund the $7.95.  Received a call from Customer Service on my voice mail, as the caller said "we are reaching out to you to see why you cancelled your membership (caller referred to me with another customer name) WOW do they have customer service issues.  I agree with another review Ross has better deals.... plus you can return no problem and no charge.

I was so excited because I found the perfect watch for my husband for our 1 year anniversary, and found a couple pairs of shoes and jewelry for myself. When I couldn't log in to my account today I contacted customer service and was told that they cancelled all of my orders and deleted my entire Ideeli account because they couldn't get a hold of me  which is complete BS - they hardly tried. My husband is disappointed because he doesn't have the watch he fell in love with, and now I don't have shoes and jewelry for a wedding I'm attending this month... what a joke. Stay away.

VI really could not be more frustrated. I used to have my ideeli purchases shipped to my job, but I recently took another job, so before I placed my last order I updated my shipping address, made my HOME my primary shipping address, and deleted all others. Imagine my surprise when I tracked my package and it is being shipped to the old address! I did a live chat immediately, and the girl was very nice but gave me two choices. Either drive two hours round trip and pick it up myself, or wait a month for the package to be returned to them and reship per. And if anyone has ever shopped ideeli before, when THEY say one month, it must really mean three. I have been emailing back and forth with the customer service "team", only to have them repeatedly infer that this was my error. I am so frustrated!!! I love the deals I can get on ideeli, but for flat rate $10 shipping from every customer, you would think that they could figure this out. If this is not resolved by the end of the day I WILL be filing a complaint with the BBB and contesting the charge with my credit card company.

Vi am disappointed with this site and company.  \u000a\u000ai placed my first order on ideeli for some accessories i'd been coveting on the designer's site (so i was happy to see it on sale), however after the order went through on the site, i never received an order confirmation email.  i figured it might take a few minutes, so i checked again a couple hours later, still no email.  then i tried logging into the ideeli site, only to find that my email and password kept coming up as invalid, and i was certain i had typed in the correct info.  i even tried using the password assistance, but it did not recognize my email address.  i kept checking my email to make sure it was the same one where i received the ideeli deal alerts.  \u000a\u000ai finally contacted their live chat help, which didn't really help me at all because they said they had to escalate my issue to another department, who was going to contact me in 1-2 business days.  furthermore, they told me that they could only see that the order was cancelled, which i had no notification for.  after reading some of these reviews, i realized that they had most likely locked (or deleted) my account on fraud suspicion.  i then checked my credit card account, and it showed two charges for about $1 each.  interesting.  the customer service rep could not explain why i was charged, nor could they tell me what it was for.  however, i received no email or phone call or any indication prior to this that anyone was trying to get in touch with me about my order, like another reviewer had mentioned.  \u000a\u000awhat makes it even more odd is that after chatting with the support representative, i received an order notification email saying "thank you for my order" and that it was "being processed," but which was basically blank, did not list any of my items, and the total amount being $0.  \u000a\u000ai'll be calling my credit card company tonight to try and do some damage control before a fraud alert is put on my card, because now i'm paranoid that every order i place online from now on will be branded as fraudulent.  thanks, ideeli.  \u000a\u000aunfortunately, the sale will be over before the other department will get back to me so i know that i will no longer be able to purchase the items.  such a shame, because this is one of my favorite designers, and was excited to be getting what i thought was a great deal.  it puts a black mark on both the designer and ideeli.

VI ordered a dress from ideeli and they sent me an email saying they were unable to complete the order. They issued a $10 voucher and promised free shipping on the next order I place. I talked to a woman on their chat service, and she was nice while I was obviously frustrated. I asked why the vendor couldn't fill the order and was told first that they didn't send the item and later when I pried a bit more, that the item "wouldn't pass ideeli's standards for quality." Ok. Fine. \u000a\u000aThat being said, I find it absolutely ridiculous, especially with the way the site is structured, that when an item is listed as "in stock" that they cannot complete my order do to "an inventory problem." I also understand that there is a quality standard, but why would you evaluate an item after you already decided to sell it.\u000a\u000aThen, I get on here and a few other sites, and oh my gosh the reviews... The fact is that a website that clearly needs to function on efficiency is obviously lack just that. I also work in customer service. If I had to apologize as many times as the rep Jason Faria from ideeli.com does, then I feel like I would have to bring that to my superiors. Maybe that has happened, but ideeli has no improvements to show for it. \u000a\u000aI do not think I will be using either the $10 voucher or the free shipping as I just cannot trust a company that says "we're always looking for ways to improve our members' shopping experiences and are very open to feedback and suggestions" and "our number one priority is providing great service to you" and there are no obvious markers of improvement.\u000a\u000aI was really looking forward to wearing that dress.

VTook a month to get the item.  Decided to return it.  Since return was only authorized for 14 days from SHIP DATE I could not process it online. Live chatted with 4 different customer service reps over a period of 2 days - all nice but giving me erroneous information.  Finally received 2 return authorizations for the same item but its been a week since first contact and still don't have the promised email with my prepaid return label.  I did receive an email stating it would take several days to process the return label - really?  why?  Now I have to contact them again because those several days have passed with nothing (not even in my spam folder)!  I will never order from them again!!  What a hassle

The next day it emailed me said the order was canceled, and asked me to contact them if I believed my order had been incorrectly identified as fraud. Then I found out not only my order was canceled, my account was also deleted! When I contact them, they said the reason was because they called me but couldn't  reach me. \u000a\u000aI strongly doubt this is the correct way to identify a fraud and treat a customer. I've met  the same situation before. I was at work and couldn't pick up the phone, but the other place only canceled my order, which I can totally understand. What ideeli.com had done is super irrational and disrespectful to customers. I feel insulted and very angry about it.

VI thought that this was a great site. I ordered a lot of clothing and had to return a great deal of it because it was either unexpectedly poor quality (paper-thin cashmere), or too big or too small. Even though I had never once opted for the store credit option, and had always opted for a refund, they are holding on to $1200 of my money!!!!!  I have sent them an email about this a month ago and only after I sent a repeat email did they send a note saying they would be replying within a couple of days.  More than a week later, still no reply and still no refund.\u000a\u000aIn many ways, I get the feeling that the customer service dept is trying, but when they actually steal $1200 of your money, it is so over-the-top.  I was hoping that they would come through so that I don't have to start figuring out how to get my money back by what? reporting them to the attorney general? Taking them to small claims court?  It will take a lot of effort to even figure out what to do and I totally resent it.\u000a\u000aBy the way, their online record of one's account is completely bollixed up.  It says that things have shipped when they have been cancelled, and many other problems.  It is completely unreliable in terms of reflecting what is actually going on in your account.\u000a\u000aIt is really confusing.  I was so appreciative when they allowed me to return things that had been termed "nonreturnable", but it turns out to not be much of a favor if they get their merchandise back but they keep your money.

VWorst online site EVER!  Save your money and spend it anywhere else but here.  Most of  the women "styles" are hideous, trampy and last years, you can get better deals at your local stores from the clearance rack, plus you can try them on.  They have such a short return policy that by the time your purchase actually arrives (weeks or longer) you've just about missed the return date.  I have so much CRAP that I could not return it's really sad.  I had a credit balance and I really think their computer system is not right.  I would buy less than what my credit balance was but yet my credit balance would go to zero!  Yes I did send an email, NO response.  There have been a few times I never even received credit for something I returned.  I would have to check on it and then email to find out what the problem was.  I was always told, "Sorry, we had a kink in our system."  Makes me wonder what if I didn't check and send the email, would they ever have credited me back?  I have wasted so much money on not being able to return things that didn't fit correctly or I didn't like.  You have something like 14 days from the day THEY SHIP from their warehouse, so you don't actually have 14 days from when you actually get the items.  I really wish I would have read the reviews before I joined.

VIdeeli is VERY hit and miss.  Their customer service is NONEXISTANT and they never seem to know what is really going on when you contact them.  On a recent order this month, they took money out of my account and I have yet to receive a tracking number. When they first opened they were actually falsely representing items, for example they had a Michael Kors Kind Duvet set they were selling which I ordered and I only received the duvet no shams, which a set normally consist of.  They later told me they were always only selling the duvet.  Well Ideeli, why would you advertise it as a duvet set?  It's things like this that give the site such an element of shadiness.  Despite that incident, I continued to shop there and 75% of the time they get it right, but their margin of error is getting larger.  I would not recommend this site to my worse enemy and after this last fiasco of my money being taken with no tracking number and no product in hand, i'm finished with them!

VI agree with the above sentiments!  DO NOT order from here!  you will be disappointed. I ordered two shirts from a sale they were running and just found out that they are not coming and are considered"lost" and I had the same nearly impossible to reach customer service as well as the "i don't really care" attitude from the CS department overall.  I had read these reviews before looking for a resolution to my missing order and it sounds like a pattern.  The last order I placed with them a pair of boots I ordered were suddenly sold out and they gave me the same $25 credit.  So I went to use it on the 2 shirts that I ordered, I used the credit and had a balance of about $63.  Granted, they are refunding me the $63 but now I have no site credit and no shirts.  My inner gut is telling me the whole site is a scam.  They lure you in on your first order, and everything goes well and it ships quickly, save one item, so they keep your membership by apologizing and giving you a $25 credit.  Then comes the second order where you actually USE the $25 credit and mysteriously the order doesn't arrive because it's "lost"  Which is ironic given that UPS had no record of the tracking number I was given.  If they lost it, at some point the would have had to posses the package !!  I think they only sell actual items to paying tier 1 customers and lure people in with the free intial membership.  SO as a tier 2 member you can order it, and pay for it but may not get it.   Don't believe their hype.  Go to Hautelook.com or reputable big box retailers like Marshall's.

I was cordial with customer service and politely asked when I would get my order and why the tracking number wasn't working.  They replied it is a KNOWN PROBLEM and it shouldn't affect my delivery. \u000a\u000aHmm.  Well, I don't think the packages actually existed.  Ideeli couldn't give me a working tracking number or an ETA.  After FIVE e-mails (no phone number), the customer service rep just said it's lost and I'd get a refund!  \u000a\u000aI'm irate I won't be getting my items I was dying to get.  But, I'm more upset I didn't get a more honest answer.  Ideeli lost it--not UPS.  \u000a\u000aOrdering from Ideeli is like playing the lottery.  \u000a\u000aUse RueLaLa, HauteLook, or Gilt instead.  Ideeli doesn't have their stuff together.

VI ordered two items from Ideeli.com which were supposedly shipped on 02/21.  I checked the UPS tracking number and UPS has no record of the item being shipped.  After emailing ideeli (there's no phone number) I was sent a canned response which was equivalent to no response at all.  Basically, I was told to check the shipping policy, wait ten days more, and then put in a claim with ideeli.  Then the items would be shipped.  This just doesn't make any sense.  They have my money, and I have no hope of getting the items any time soon.  This site has good stuff and good prices, but their shipping procedures and customer service has a lot to be desired.  I have made several purchases from the site in the last six months and this is the third such problem with shipping.  I have never encountered anything like it on other websites (ebay, overstock, ect.).  Three strikes and they are out.  Apparently they do not care whether I remain a customer or not.

I have learned to print out my chats with agents to refer back to especially when I have a concern. On 2/17 I purchased a top, it was shipped on 2/20 and i have yet to receive it. I understand now that it takes "ten business days" for the shipment however, why isn't the tracking number working? I should be able to view where the package is and its estimated date of delivery. I was told and I quote "We are experiencing a known issue with our shippers' tracking information not reflecting. We are working diligently to correct this as soon as possible." Same comment from the last time. The agent more or less said I don't know what the problem is and we apologize. While you have my money for not one but two items. Unbelieveable. I ended my conversation by stating if I do not receive the item I will (and I will) go to the Better Business Bureau file and complaint and in turn go to my bank cancel all charges and never ever deal with them again. Please do not use this site they are a complete and utter rip-off. Cute clothes but they arent' cute if I can't wear them. Fraudulent service.

VI placed an order with Ideeli and was very excited to receive it, as I really really wanted those items. \u000aWhen I finally got the package, 4 out of the 5 items on the packing list included in the package were missing!!! Ideeli said that my package got lost in transit, and all they did was refund me the money for the items that did not arrive, but my funds were blocked for over 3 weeks. I was very disappointed with this experience, since it was obviously a packing employee that did not place the items in the box. They did not offer any store credit and were very slow to respond. \u000aI used to be a loyal customer, and have placed over 40 orders in the past 2 years. Most orders arrived as expected, althought they did send me wrong colors in the past, but were helpful in refunding me the shipping cost as well. I was hoping that they'd compensate me forthe huge invonvenience they have caused with this last order, but they failed to do so. They claimed that everything in their inventory matches up, so all they can do is refund me the price ofthe items that were missing. Really? What if the items ended up in a different package by accident? Why do I have to suffer because of an Ideeli employee's mistake? I'll stick to HauteLook.com from now on, they have even offered me 20% refund if I agreed to keep items they sent in the wrong color, and their customer service is great! On my last two orders they even combined the shipping charges!

VSO disappointed!! I have been with Ideeli for awhile now, but it's only recently that I've had issues with them. This latest problem is what really made me mad, and I will never shop from them again, no matter how tantalizing their prices are. I placed two orders fairly recently. I had used a $25 credit on my first purchase, but then the order was canceled. I spoke to an Ideeli representative who assured me that I still had a $25 credit in my account, even though it did not show up visually in my account. I MADE CERTAIN that I still had the credit - I asked him how I should place my order, if my credit card would be charged $25 less - basically, I had to make sure that nothing would go wrong, especially since I had seen this site before and all the bad reviews. (I just didn't really believe them, since most of my previous orders had gone smoothly.) But then I placed my order, WHILE IN CORRESPONDENCE with the sales representative, and waited for the charge to show up a couple days later. The sales representative did not reply to my last message, which, AS REQUESTED BY THE SALES REPRESENTATIVE, stated that I had placed the order, and could someone refund me the $25 back? I should have expected then that I was charged the full price of the order. I wrote back to Ideeli, using the same thread in which I had been speaking to the representative on the day of my last order, and they asked for my order number. There is no response from them now. I am so, so irritated - and yes, $25 isn't an insanely large sum, but as a college student....I have to make do with a scrappy student income. And I'm just so frustrated with the customer service, which outright lied to me.

VI wouldn't count on them at all. I purchased an item 29 of Jan, and I supposed to receive it at 3 of Feb. I bought it as a Valentine's day gift. Today is 13 of Feb and I still didn't receive it. I communicated with them three times. First time, they promised that I will receive it soon. Second time, they said they don't know where is my package. After all, they send me an email with this respond \u000a"We have notified the shipping company and they will be starting an investigation into the issue within 24 hours. Their investigation should be resolved within 8 business days and they may contact you via phone during that time." !!!!!!!!\u000aTomorrow is Valentine's day and they want to investigate and resolve the problem  within 8 days!!!!! So I should tell to my boyfriend that he will receive his Valentine's day gift within 8 days!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is unacceptable for the online purchase  site, which their commitment to on time shipping is the first rule to be successful.

VIt was great to browse the website after receiving emails about their "sales." A lot of the clothing seemed a little expensive when you consider that a lot of it is not returnable, despite not being able to try it on. Then there was an offer for a two-month membership in a wine club, that would yield 6 bottles of wine for $79, so I decided to try it. Turned out, that club didn't deliver to MA, where I live. I contacted them and they said I needed to get the refund from Ideeli. \u000aUpon my first request, about two months ago, I got an apology and a promise of a refund within 5 days. No refund was ever posted to my account. I have wasted much precious time sending more messages to their customer service, including two "live chats," with no result. The last "chat" received a response that I would be contacted again within 24 hours, only that was over a week ago. \u000a\u000aNo company should be allowed to (1) misrepresent an item as for sale if one cannot receive it in the state from which it is ordered. The original ad should have listed the states where the company will deliver, and (2) ignore a reasonable request for a refund. It's not that I didn't like the wine, it's that I never received any! I wouldn't buy anything from this company!

VSO FAR THE "BIGGEST SCAM" I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCE.. they charge u a feed to be a "FIRST ROW" custumer so u can have access to the sales 1 hour earlier than other people, well happens that as soon as the sale start the website dropdown and send u an error saying that the website is busy, try again later, meanwhile that item u have been waiting on is gone because they overload the site with custumers their network can't handle, over 4 millions to be exactly, but theres no such capacity for that amount, that why the website drops all the time as soon as the sales start. Then if u try to complaint with a customer rep they would tell u that is not their fault and theres nothing they can do for u.. ARE U KIDDING ME?? so is my fault the u have more custumerst on ur website than the network can actually handle just to charge a feed? thats BS. Horrible customer service, and horrible buying experience. I do not recomend this website!

VI've been a member of this site for over 2 years now and have spent thousands of dollars, but no more. I will never make another purchase at this site. In the beginning I liked the prices and choices, but now after receiving crappy quality clothing marked as brand names and horrible customer service, I am done with this site! I bought a pair of Amrita Singh earrings for my sister for Christmas, they fell apart as she opened the package. So embarrassing! I bought a dress to wear at a wedding in one occasion, as I sitting down at the table I could hear the material ripping, again very embarrassing. I was sent the wrong size in one occasion, and turns out I have to pay for shipping when it's their fault. Then, I've had at least two friends who have purchased from the site and I was given the credit to then have the credit taken away from me because of "fraud suspicion". I've had two orders canceled where I attempted to use the credits. But if I put in a new order without using the credit, it is surprisingly not fraud. Unbelievable! I'm so sick of this company, and its horrible merchandise and customer service!

VI ordered 5 Tart Inifinity Maxi dresses in black for my bridesmaids from ideeli.com. When they arrived the one medium sized dress was the exact dress I ordered, the other 4 (size small for all of them) were knee length versions of the dress. I attempted to email and live chat with ideeli.com and couldn't get a response. Upon further research I found a phone number and finally got an answer after two phone calls - they sold out of the maxi length and found it an okay substitution to send me these knee length dresses instead. I had no prior warning or notification. The person I spoke with made it sound like he was doing me a favor by providing free return shipping on the items he sent me that were wrong and coudln't understand why it was an issue. I would absolutely NEVER shop with ideeli again and would highly recommend anyone considering it to ponder if they care if they get the exact product they ordered or something ideeli independently deems an okay "substitution".

VI thought I was placing an order in order to use a $58 credit that I had available. I even got an order number.  When I went to check the website for order delivery information it showed that my order did not go through and I had a balance of $58.  It showed me my order and asked if I wanted to reorder.  Of course I said yes, because I wanted to use my credit.  The website then asked for my credit card info.  I thought to myself why when I have more than enough credit to cover the order in full.  I decided to "speak" to a representative.  I spoke to Esther.  The entire "conversation" was confusing.  Esther didn't know if she was coming or going.  She gave me so much misinformation and blamed it on the computer system.  She asked if she could call and I said yes.  Over the phone she told me that according to Ideeli's policy I must give credit card information even if I had sufficient credit.  I informed Esther that I did not trust Ideeli's system enough to given my credit card info because I might get charged and Ideeli may issue me another unusable credit.  She tried to understand my misgivings with Ideeli's system but reiterated the policy.  I asked why I just couldn't order the merchandise with her on the phone using my available credit and she stated she could not do that and I must give my credit card info.  I refused to do that and she stated there was nothing she could do for me.  She wouldn't get anyone else on the phone because no one could do anything for me.  So, even though I already took a $10 hit on the shipping the entire amount is now a bust because Ideeli will not allow me to order merchandise without using a credit card!  What a shame!  Ideeli should be very ashamed of their policy.  I would understand if I owed a balance, but that was not the case.  I will have to agree with order negative reviews.  I am happy that some people are comfortable inputting their credit card info.  That is not a chance I am willing to make with a company that refuses to work with me.  I have learned my lesson and will ensure that all the women I know, which are a lot because I am a nurse at a major teaching hospital, know not to shop with Ideeli unless they are willing to risk losing all their money.

VI've ordered a couple items from here and it is the WORST customer service when dealing with credits and returns. I had exchanged emails with them regarding a small credit and they kept messing it up even after saying they were going to fix it. Because I recently had a credit I decided to use it (I wish I just bought something for the same price of my credit and not more). \u000aI decided to return the items (I wish I didnt have to do this) and went to their site to let them know I was wanting to return them. \u000aThey make it a really miserable experience by charging you for return shipping. \u000aI figured I didnt want to pay for the return shipping since I already paid 9.95 to ship it to begin with. I clicked "credit" instead of "return" and saw that some was going to credit (from the previous credit) and the rest to refund. WHY??????\u000aSo I just emailed to put it all on credit. But actually, after reading these reviews I want my money back. \u000aI havent heard back yet, since I just emailed today-but honestly it isnt worth the hassle.I just want my money back and will be happy doing my shopping at the other sites I have had easier experiences with.  I have purchased from Ruelala and it is WAY more professional, and helpful. I dont want to pay for shipping if many other sites offer it at no cost, low cost, or is hassle free.

VI can only agree with just about everything everyone is saying here. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE ERROR. I currently live in Denmark and had to come home for a family emergency and had a package from ideeli at home waiting for my dad to ship for me home to Copenhagen good thing he hadn't as it would have been a waste of his time and mine. These jokers first of marked on their site that both of my items were shipped as I ordered two of the same item so when I opened my package and saw only one was in there I was pissed to say the least. Why didn't the bother to send me an email or even mark on their site I only got one? Then to make things worse they tried to pull a bait and switch on me sending the mini back up I luv battery and not the large I ordered. Really like I wouldn't notice? It doesn't even work for my iPad and to boot it was a cheaper item. Not a happy camper. So I tried to call no phone number listed more red flags. Then I get someone on iChat who was no help. Offered me store credit I said um no as I will never use you again and I want a full refund. He said ok but I had to send the item back which also came in a damaged box btw. I said sure but I wanted the item I never got credited now and said no, other item had to be returned first. That makes no sense I never got the item so give me my money back. I got the return label on the product I did get and I will return but these jokers labeled it as the product I should have gotten and not what I actually got.  To make matters worse the only reason I,placed the order was because I got an an email saying that my wait list was over and item became available when it apparently never was. So sure you want my money and don't want to give me the product nice sceme you have going. Off to the media and better business bureau I go stopping at some friends along the way to stop even looking at their site. Oh and ps I got a number that no one bothers to answer lovely.

They cancelled the order.  I've been going back and forth. As of today, a supervisor told me the best they would do is give me $15 off. Although I have the transcripts of the whole thing, and it was ideeli's fault that my percentage never came off, they will not honor their initial offer. This has been going on for weeks. The way they didn't handle this sucks! I would advise others to find other places to shop.

VIdeeli sent me what they had on hand as opposed to the exact item I ordered. They pictured one thing and mailed me a completely different item. I called, e-mailed (pictures of what was order and the botched item sent), and chatted. They rarely answer the phone, and chat stated they are sorry I "felt" I was sent the wrong item. If I order a black pant and was sent a hot pink mini I did not feel I got the wrong thing...I did get the wrong thing. In Desperation to get the right item I tried again. Ideeli can not be compared to similar sites as it is clear they have no idea of what is being sent to customers, and they do not seem capable of understanding bait and switch is illegal and bad business. Ideeli is not interested in sending the items pictured- they will send what they "feel" is the item posted for sale. It only took me weeks to get my refund, and this last order will be just that if they send me the wrong item again. I wish I read these reviews before I shopped with them.

VMy niece saw boots that she absolutely loved Ideeli.com. They were labeled as Matisse Becky boots in black. I decided that I was going to buy them for her for Christmas. I had plenty of time. However when the boots arrived on the December 17th they were not the boots I had ordered from the photo on the site. Having no customer service number to call I had to contact them via chat. The first person I was chatting with could not answer my questions and blamed the vendor for putting the wrong boots in the box. I tried to tell her that my internet research showed that the boot I ordered was indeed called the Matisse Becky boot that their site posted the wrong photo, resulting in me buying a mislabeled product and not having a gift for my niece. She would not give me a number to call or transfer me to a supervisor and proceeded to 'disconnect' when I asked her what was the real name of the boot in the picture they posted. At this point I am fuming. I reconnect to a different chat and explain the issue all over again. She apologized for the 'inconvenience' and said she sees a return label was already issued. Yet still could not direct me to anyone who knows what boot they took a picture of. Thanks ideeli for taking my money, mislabeling a product, leaving me with no gift for my niece and no answer to my question.

If they'd live up to their promises of packages getting to you in time for the holidays as they had promised on their website & some decent customer service.  Ordering on 12/14 & not getting deliveries when promised is considered false advertising.  Unhelpful "chat" customer service telling you that this is all in the hands of the US Postal Service when order was shipped UPS doesnt help; in addition to customer service consisting of only being able to leave a message on voicemail promising a call back by the end of the day & then not getting a call back either.

Christmas and Hannukah are here and I have no package.  Is it lost, stolen, never sent?  Who knows!  The live chat people over on ideeli don't know anything and can't locate my package!  What did I pay $10 delivery charge for?  So it can get lost?  On the holidays no less?  And it's not the first time either.  Ideeli either needs to change the way they do business/delivery or they will be fast out of business!  By the way, I live in NYC, there is no reason a packge should take two weeks to get delivered after being sent!

VI'm going to go ahead and echo the remarks about the customer service being absolutely awful at ideeli.  If you choose to shop there, you are taking a big risk.  It's great if everything with your order goes fine, but if something goes wrong, be prepared for a giant nightmare.\u000a\u000aI have had to return half of the items that ideeli has sent me because I am continuously sent the wrong items.  In fact, I have actually been sent the EXACT SAME wrong item TWICE.  Ideeli will try to charge you for shipping for their error, and they will try to only give you store credit.  When it's the company that makes the error, you'd imagine they'd be bending over backwards to apologize and keep you as their customer.  NOT SO with ideeli.\u000a\u000aFor me, it's gotten to the point where it's just not worth the risk anymore.  There are plenty of other websites just like this one that I can use and I don't have to worry about getting screwed over yet again.  And, as an additional bonus, I will actually get the items I ordered!\u000a\u000aDON'T TAKE THE RISK.  IT IS NOT WORTH IT.

VHi,\u000a\u000aWriting here hoping that SOMEONE (hopefully YOU, Jason F!) will finally answer me. I have been trying to get in contact with someone from Ideeli.com for the past week to no avail. Over 10 Voice Messages on their Customer Service hotline, several emails to Support, and 5 "live-chat" conversations. My shipment was sent to the wrong address (Ideeli's fault, not my own, as I had the correct address on my account), and then returned to Ideeli's port at 300 Nixon Lane in Edison, NJ. No one via "Live Chat" will reship my order or issue me a refund, but they promise that someone will "call me right away" (which of course, 7 days later, still has not happened). These were CHRISTMAS GIFTS that I needed to receive by 12/21, They have been sitting at 330 Nixon Lane for a week now, and I will not receive them by 12/21 unless they are RUSH SHIPPED. If I cannot receive them by 12/21, I want a full refund (NOT a credit), as this is Ideeli's mistake. I also am disgusted by the lack of customer service, and I am about to report this business to the BBB. There is no reason your customers should not be answered, or have to spend this much of their time trying to get a hold of someone from your company. Completely unacceptable.\u000a\u000aJason Faria - if you are truly the Sr. Manager of Customer Service, can you PLEASE help me?

Both of them placed orders, and while they did not receive the merchandise in a very timely fashion - both were satisfied with their purchases.  Last week I placed an order with ideeli and received a a confirmation receipt.  The next day I got an e-mail from ideeli saying my order had been cancelled due to "fraud".  No explanation, just a curt, rather rude e-mail notice accusing me of fraud!  When I inquired via e-mail I was told that there were 3 accounts at my address (yes, there ARE 3 people that live at my home...) and that was fraudulent practice.  I sent an e-mail back explaining the circumstances and never received a reply.  I think it is very bad customer service to just send an e-mail cancelling an order and accusing the customer of "fraud".  I will cancel all three of our accounts and continue to use sites that have excellent customer service such as Rue La La and MyHabit.  Al 3 of us that live at the same address are allowed to have acccounts - and believe me, we use them frequently.  I will NEVER use ideeli, or refer to them again.  Oh, and by the way... I found the item I tried to purchase from them (and they cancelled) at a much better price with free shipping on another site!  UPDATE**I thought I would e-mail ideeli customer service one more time to give them a chance to make things right.  Sent them an in depth e-mail describing my experience.  I got back a one-line response... Thanks for contacting us, we'll cancel your accounts... No apology or attempt to retain me as a customer, yikes!!  With service like this (and sites that review it), I doubt they will be around to alienate customers for much longer!

VHere is the problem I have with Ideeli... \u000a*First you pay a monthly membership fee. \u000a*Then you are given only 15 minutes to make up your mind if you want to buy    an item. \u000a*But most all you pay $9.95 for shipping and anything I have ever order from this web site takes 10 days before if reaches your door step.\u000aIt's a rip off folks.  Don't be fooled!

VI've been ordering from Ideeli for quite some time, and spent hundreds of dollars on items that never quite seemed up-to-par in quality. However, my last order was the final nail in the coffin. Ideeli has firmly cemeted itself as an unreliable company with shoddy customer service that makes shopping online a far more difficult and frustrating process than it ought to be, especially when there are amazing alternatives with superior service including Rue La La, Gilt Group, and The Outnet. \u000a\u000aI purchased from Ideeli a Dolce and Gabbana dress on final sale, knowing there was likely only one dress available in stock that I was happy to nab. The shipping time was slow, but when I finally received the box, I opened it to find a completely different item that I did not order but was labeled incorrectly in the plastic casing. \u000a\u000aIdeeli has no telephone customer service available, so I sent an email and received no respsonse whatsoever. Then when I chatted online with a representative, she basically just said that the shipping team makes mistakes and sends out wrong items on occasion. I asked if they knew where my dress that I actually ordered and paid for was, and she said there was no way for them to track it down. I asked her how they would know if they sent it to the wrong customer, and she said they didn't know. Um, excuse me? She only offered me a $10 credit to make it right. 10 whole dollars for their sorry excuse of service? No thanks. \u000a\u000aI sent the mistaken package back to them, and never received an update on my order even after tracking the package showed it was received by their warehouse. I online chatted again with a different represetnative, who only said I would receive a refund and could not answer any questions I had about the original item purchased. I really just wanted my dress, but apparently expecting to receive what you paid for is too high of an expectation at Ideeli. \u000a\u000aTheir representatives make it sound like its such a rarity and that mistakes happen but they don't even come close to making it right for customers. I'll be sticking with tried and true sites that have always been amazing with service and quality like Gilt and RueLaLa and ending my membership with Ideeli. Shopping online really shouldn't have to be so frustrating. \u000a\u000aDo yourself a favor, take your money and your time elsewhere from Ideeli. It's just not worth the frustration. My co-workers and friends have seen all the time and angst I've had to spend on this stupid order, and have followed suit in shopping at better sites.

VUPDATE - I changed my rating to a 1-star.  Worst customer service ever.  DO NOt WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.\u000a\u000aI've ordered quite a bit from Ideeli in the past 18 months.  I've purchased women's clothing, men's/boys' clothing, and home goods.  For the most part, I've had good experiences.  but at the end of the day, a bad experience or two poorly handled by the Ideeli team has left me just not too interested in returning.\u000a\u000aGenerally speaking, the clothing items i've ordered have been good to excellent quality, excellent to *amazing* deals, and mostly true to size.  i've had a few items tailored after arrival (no returns allowed on those), but I have things tailored often, so I was not dismayed by this.  \u000a\u000aMost of the home items I've ordered have been good.  However, I ordered a pair of soup tureens and one was completely broken.  I never heard back from CS on this.  Around the same time I orderd about three sets of highballs and an equal number of lowball glassware sets.  there were broken glasses in each, and again.., no response from CS.  I also ordered two cake plates (that match the style of the soup tureens) and again....one was broken.  and....you guessed it....no response from CS.\u000a\u000aIn truth I've spent over $10k on the ideeli site, and most everything has been good.  Do i think they should be responsive to product issues?  yes.  should I have been provided replacements?  of course.  But i was not.  The loss is overall a small % of what I've spent, so I cannot rate my overall experience too poorly.  In fact, I've clearly loved Ideeli for the most part.  i've not stopped shopping there entirely, but I'm now more prone to visiting other sites first.  The damaged items not replaced really bothered me.  \u000a\u000aShipping is pretty quick, or at least within the timeframe provided.  I've had one item cancelled, and I received a $25 credit.  I've also receivede credits for slow-to-ship items.  which i appreciated.  I urge caution that items are usually NOT returnable; I've never returned an item so I cannot comment here.  I do know they emails to CS about damagaed items were dead in the water.\u000a\u000aWill I shop again here?  Likely....on the more equitable sales.  Do I have low expectations of this site now?  Absolutely.  Will I refer to friends?  nope.  I think my bad experiences have trumped the good.  \u000a\u000aIdeeli needs to realize when you offer high-quality items, your client base expects more than dead-in-the-water emails to CS.  I'll NEVER buy anything that can break (so shoes and clothing it will be).  And over time i'll stop popping in to look at deals.  their loss.

VI ordered two coats on 9/30/11 which was charged to my credit card but untill today there is no sign of package being delivered.  I contacted Ideeli on 10/23/11, first the CS Rep stated that the package had been delivered.  When I gave her the tracking number, she stated that the package had been delivered in July.  Wake up!  I ordered the coats in September. \u000aApparently the tracking number Ideeli provided was not correct.  \u000aIt is a nightmare, I have wasted hours calling UPS and USPS to track the package, but in vain.  Both tell me to contact Ideeli, when I call Ideeli, they tell me to call UPS.\u000aFacts:  1. I was charged $289.93 was a product that still has not been delivered.\u000a2.  I was promised delivery within 10 Days for which I paid $9.95. \u000a\u000aThis is not acceptable.

VI would not recommend Ideeli to anyone.  Customer Service who seem to be hired guns, with polite typical answers.  They email you to let you know they're working on your issue... then, you just don't hear from them.  my package is lost in the mail, and even with a tracking number, no one seems to have ever heard of it... not even the usps. I simply want a refund for my items, but wouldn't you know I'd have to return them... well that would be hard considering I never received them.  This website seems to be a scam and I am horribly disappointed that I didn't receive my items.  I wanted to like Ideeli and give them my business... but if I were you, I'd stay away.  There's a reason there are so many issues below.

VIDEELI IS THE WORSE SCAM ON EARTH!!!! 10 days ago i purchased a dress and everything seemed to run smoothly - it was immediately shipped and arrived on time. i open the box and...is this a joke? the dress was labeled as the one i bought but was not at all the one i ordered. i send email immediately to customer service and also contact them via chat....here i copy the conversation so that you can judge yourself what a SCAM this company is. \u000a\u000aKaren: Welcome to ideeli\u000aAnna: hello\u000aAnna: i received an item whoch is not what i ordered\u000aKaren: I am sorry to hear you received the wrong item. I will be glad to check on it for you. May I have the order number, please?\u000aAnna: 32036706\u000aKaren: Thanks. One moment, please.\u000aKaren: That was for the ABS COLLECTION Sheer Tiered Sleeveless Dress, right?\u000aAnna: yes\u000aKaren: I'm sorry\u2014I checked with our warehouse and we unfortunately no longer have that item in stock. Due to the nature of our site we have a very limited inventory, which is how we keep our prices so low. \u000aAnna: this is ridicolous\u000aAnna: it's like a scam\u000aAnna: you send an item which i do not want\u000aAnna: and u tell me that the item i paid for\u000aAnna: is not available\u000aKaren: I'm so sorry to hear that you received the wrong item. Be on the lookout for an email from us with a pre-paid UPS return shipping label. Just print out that label, attach it to your package, and drop it off at UPS. Once we receive the item at our warehouse we will exchange it for what you ordered if we have it in stock. If the item is no longer available, we will issue a refund to the original method of payment.\u000aAnna: i want a refund now\u000aAnna: i don't care if u send a wrong item\u000aAnna: you ahve no right of taking my money\u000aAnna: and send me an item which i never wanted\u000aAnna: when u kept my money for 10 days now for an item which u probably never had\u000aKaren: We will be happy to refund your original method of payment once we receive the item back at the warehouse. I am extremely sorry for the inconvenience which this has caused you.\u000aAnna: idelii is the worse scam ever\u000aAnna: i will make sure all websites know it\u000aAnna: so that people are aware\u000aAnna: i purchased an item and ideeli must send me that item\u000aAnna: i do not care its not in stock\u000aAnna: if it was out of stock\u000aAnna: u should have not sold it to me\u000aAnna: how can the item not be in stock\u000aAnna: if i bought it\u000aKaren: Again, I am very sorry. Unfortunately, we no longer have that item in stock, so we are unable to send it to you. We sent you the wrong item, and I am extremely sorry for all the frustration this has caused you. We will be happy to issue a refund if you would like to send us the incorrect item back, but since we do not have any more of that dress, it would be impossible for us to send it to you.\u000aAnna: why do you sell items which u do not have in stock\u000aAnna: this is called scam\u000aAnna: and i will sue you\u000aAnna: this is my first and last experience with your website\u000aAnna: but i will make sure this does not end here\u000aAnna: you fool people unaware\u000aAnna: i will make sure more people will be aware \u000aAnna: moreover\u000aKaren: Anna, I understand that this has been a very unsatisfying experience for you. I am very sorry for that. We are happy to receive the incorrect item and refund your original method of payment as well as the shipping charge; unfortunately, since the dress is no longer available, we have no way of sending it to you. \u000aAnna: i want the refund immediawely\u000aAnna: i will send the item back\u000aAnna: but i want the refund immediately\u000aAnna: i NEVER wanted this item u sent\u000aAnna: so i do not see why i should wait for my moeny back\u000aKaren: We are unable to issue the refund until we receive the return at the warehouse. I apologize for the inconvenience.\u005c\u000aAnna: what a scam\u000aAnna: ideeli is worse than a joke\u000aAnna: u r not providing the item i bought\u000aAnna: and on top of it i have to wait that an itwm i never ordered gets back\u000aAnna: i don't have time\u000aAnna: to print labels drive to ups etc etc\u000aAnna: who reimburses me for the wasted time and effort\u000aKaren: I would be happy to issue a discount credit in the amount of $15 for your inconvenience.\u000aAnna: i don't care about any store credit!!! i do not want to buy anything from ur scam store\u000aAnna: i will copy this conversation and publish it on all the websites so that people know what to expect

VUnfortunately, I have not had a good experience with this place. It's actually a bit of a joke. You order something, you pay for it, plus you pay shipping then you may or may not get it!!?? I ordered a dress and a pair of flats to go with it. ONE month later I get an email that first: I will not be receiving the flats, and second my dress has finally shipped! Why would I want anything a month later especially after I was told that is was on its way weeks ago?  They must be making a huge profit on shipping because it always takes 6-10 Business Days, so when the item ships you will still have to wait 1-2 weeks for the delivery. If I paid Fed Ex 10 dollars I would have the item in 3 business day! Ideeli claims they use UPS but they don't, you get a message saying "delivered to a local post office". Each time I get a UPS tracking number and USPS ends up delivering the item a week or two weeks later. I finally got fed up with this and contacted customer service. Her response was a shrug; sorry we cannot do anything about our vendors. This is unacceptable. I paid for shipping I should get the item in a timely manner or at least my money back because it did not come when it was supposed to. I recommend dealing with a place that can stand behind their products and service. The products are rarely correct with their sizing charts and you can find the same products in any Macys or Nordstrom on sale for a less expensive price.

VI have been a member of this site for a little over a year now and have found the customer service to be horrendous!  When you reach out to them for assistance they either ignore your emails or don't have the answer to your question. If you have to return an item for a problem, that was no fault of yours, they will not replace the item with the correct/undamaged item.  They fail to see that there was a reason for ordering the item in the first place---you wanted it!  I have discovered that they only give you an e-mail address so they can ignore you when they feel the need to. I believe the procedure they have in place is: whoever gets an e-mail, answers the e-mail; so you will often get different answers for one problem if you're not satisfied with their answer. They had an area on their web site called "discussion" where you could ask a question or post a review about an item on sale.  I found this to be helpful because, quite often, other customers would answer your question based on: 1) buying the item in the past or, 2) having knowledge about the brand.  Some customers used it as a way to express their dissatisfaction with Ideeli and, believe me, there were a lot of dissatisfied customers so they did away with it for fear of losing customers. Yes, the shipping can be slow so you have to really pay attention to the return date, if the item is returnable. If you need an item right away, you might not want to place an order with them. Another thing worth mentioning is that you only get a credit for a return; you have to place another order because you won't get your money back!  I have had it with them and plan to take my business elsewhere.  There are other sites that I have used and have found them capable and willing to resolve an issue/problem.  Ideeli, needs to overhaul their customer service department and adopt the customer service policies that Nordstrom has in place.

Vi love ordering through internet since i don't like the inconvenience of going to the store and trying to find a parking not to mention the cost of the gas. so far so good until i have encountered this site. my order took forever to come for onething. if you like to spend so much time trying to figure out on  how to return item,this is a  perfect site. they don't make it easy at all. and  do keep in mind your credit card  will not be credited for your return item,you will have credit with their store. unbelievable.now i am stuck and had to buy something from aideel. i had to read other people's comment trying to find the phone number where i can talk to someone because i needed help. no phone no. on the packing slip whatsoever.... i was ready to call bbb for this. terrible experience. i will just try to use my credit from my return since it 's their policy to keep peolple's money for return and not ever ever will use this site ever again.......

VI bought a dress from this website... What a disappointing experience so far.\u000aAt first, I was hesitant to purchase from it cause it look to good to be true... I thought the shipping and handling was expensive, but I said what the hell... I purchase my item last month and still has not arrive ... I been keeping an eye on the tracking number ,... I even purchase something from eBay two weeks later since my purchase from ideeli  and Ebay arrived today... status on tracking number seems to be stuck god knows where... Chat room asked me that it was in transit .. they did not specify exactly the day of arrival... Message from USPS says the same thing for over 5 days .... People do not buy anything from ideeli.com... they suck at customer service... I have been in marketing for several years never in my life experience anything like this... I will spread the word with family and friends beware people

VI've had 2 out of 3 orders delayed.  This is on top of their already slow delivery system which usually takes an order about 2-3+ weeks for it to be delivered.  \u000a\u000aTo give you an idea:\u000aI made an order on 9/5 with expected shipping between 9/23-29.  When I checked UPS tracking number, it seems they shipped the items on 9/29 with delivery either today, 10/5 or tomorrow.  Wasn't I supposed to receive the items (at latest) the day they shipped it???  \u000a\u000aSo I have two complaints:\u000a1.  Why is their delivery system so freaking slow???  Other online flash sale sites ship and deliver within a week.\u000a2.  Why is it delayed even further???\u000a\u000aI understand that they have vendors who ship the items.  But it's ideeli who is ultimately responsible for the delivery as I am purchasing these items from them.  \u000a\u000aAlthough they have some great sales, it's not worth the time and money.  And forget about buying items as gifts, unless that person's birthday is a year away.

VI am disgusted with the poor customer service, the long shipping times and the lost packages from Ideeli.com.  Every order takes one month or longer to receive (ridiculous! - I pay the same amount as other customers but have to have my shipment delivered by UPS ground then transfered to USPS package services which ships my item to me via BOAT, wth?) At least offer the option of sending via faster shipping with higher cost-geez. But the worst thing is that after waiting a month, they lose my packageS - yes 2 of them, from the same order?!!!  One was delivered to an address in another state and the other package was marked "moved left no forwarding address" I have lived in the house for over 4 years. Unbelievable.  So I chat for about 20 minutes with the customer agent who barely speaks or spells proper English and request that all of my orders not yet shipped be cancelled and any credit due should be refunded to my credit card.  She tells me only $48 can be returned to my card out of $500+ What?! She says that unless it is the fault of Ideeli that they will only issue refunds in form of credit. I told her that this entire mess was because of Ideeli and aske that they issue me a refund not only for the order that is over one month old, sent in two shipments (why?) and BOTH lost but also for all of the orders not yet shipped which I do not want to wait over a month for. She said she could not. \u000a\u000aTo date, I got $10 credit for my inconvenience. I plan to open a BBB claim and file a case with the Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Protection Agency.\u000a\u000aIDEELI is terrible.

V" Horrible customer service!\u000a\u000aI make a purchase on July 31, 2011. The order was sent in two packages. The first package had a ship date of August 1 - 3. I did not receive an email confirmation so I emailed them on August 8 to inquire. I was told that Ideeli just started to use a combination of sending packages USPS and UPS (to save money) so it may take longer.The first package tracking indicated it reached the sorting facility in San Pablo, CA on August 8, 2011 (not final destination); the second package reached San Pablo on August 18. I emailed again on Sept 25 stating I still have not received the package. The response is that the shipping does take longer and sorry for the confusion. \u000a\u000aOn August 30, I receive the SECOND package and I emailed Ideeli again about the first package and asked if they can refund my money. Their response was that they cannot cancel my order but will start an investigation that will be resolved within 8 days. \u000a\u000aOn Sept 8, I emailed idelli again for the results of their investigation. Their response was that the package is at a sorting facility and will be delivered within 4 - 6 weeks from when it first arrived there.\u000a\u000aOn Sept 12 (6 weeks from when it first arrived in San Pablo), I chat online with one of the ideeli representatives. She was very nice and asked if I could wait for another week. If there was no movement on the tracking number she would refund my money. \u000a\u000aToday, Sept 21, I chatted online with another representative. I explained everything that happened and she told me that she cannot do anything but will send an email to the technical group to look into this further. She also stated that the order can be refunded when the package is deemed lost (when the tracking states delivered, but you have not received it.) When I asked what happens if it never gets delivered, she had no answer for me.

VI'm a relatively long time repeat customer of ideeli, so I can see the pros and cons.  If you love every single thing you order and never have to experience their return process then they're a great site.  I love the amazing deals you can find.  I love the variety.  I love a lot of the things I've ordered from them...\u000a\u000aBUT\u000a\u000aIn order of worst to least worst:\u000a* Returns are a bigger pain in the as$ than an anal fissure.  I've often had to wait 2-3 weeks after ideeli received my return before the credit is posted to my account (they don't offer refunds).  My biggest problem with their returns department to date is that at the start of August I ordered two handbags and both turned out to be faulty.  Ideeli kindly agreed to refund me the cost of the order plus shipping.  I returned the bags over 3 weeks ago (separately because they broke at different times) and the tracking numbers show that the returns were received around Sept 1st, yet somehow I've only been refunded for one of the bags.  I've emailed support and tried to get to the bottom of this, but I really feel like I'm talking to a brick wall.  I don't understand why, when someone is inquiring into the status of two returns amounting to a total of $99.95, anyone would think that telling them that ONE return for $45 had been processed would solve the problem.  I KNOW that one of the returns has been refunded to me \u2013 THAT'S WHY I'M CONTACTING YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE!  What I really want to know is what happened to the other one?  Where is the rest of my money?\u000a\u000a[deep breath] \u2013 other comments: \u000a\u000a* Their flat rate shipping is expensive.  C'mon guys - $9.95 to ship one dress?\u000a* You often have to wait 2-3 weeks between placing the order and receiving it.  This is partially due to the fact that they use UPS sure-post, which transfers the package to the local post office at the end of the delivery.  My local post office tends to be quite sh*t, so even after the tracking number says a package was delivered I don't tend to see it for another 3-4 days.\u000a* Some of the sizing information is off.  I'm definitely not a size 0, but if I order my normal size (2-4) I tend to be swimming in all the items.\u000a\u000aAll up, I used to love ideeli, but I'm so jaded by the lack of responsiveness by their returns and support departments that I just can't bring myself to shop there anymore.  I'm totally, completely, utterly sick to death of having to battle to get a refund or credit.  All the while they have my money, but I have no product because it's either in the mail on it's way to me, in the mail on it's way back to them, or their returns department is sitting in a circle twiddling their thumbs and looking at my return, but not actually doing anything about it.  Sort it out guys!

VThe Problem:\u000a1) I never received my package\u000a2) My package was sent from UPS to a random local post office without any notice\u000a3) Complained to "ideeli Customer Service" and didn't get a response back\u000a\u000aThis my first time and probably my last time shopping at ideeli.\u000aI ordered a watch THREE WEEKS ago (also additional 2 weeks for the product to actually ship out) and still have not received any package.\u000aThe following shipment said it was delivered by a local post office but\u000ahaven't received anything from the mail. I am extremely frustrated and upset to have paid so much on my first product ever bought on ideeli and to found that UPS decides to send it to a local post office... who probably has lost the item or cannot be found. Who knows?\u000aI have no contact on how to contact the random local post office to retrieve\u000amy item since ideeli is terrible at giving us any information or acknowledgment but the acceptance of our credit card numbers.\u000a\u000aNow I'm just finding ways to file a complaint to ideeli for it's irresponsible shipping\u000ahandling. DO NOT USE THIS SITE to buy anything from them. It won't be worth the hassle.

VWhen they said you should listen to your first instinct they were right. I HATE HATE HATE to shop at places that only offer store credit for items returned because no matter what the store does or how they're at fault they force you to keep a relationship with them that way.  Ideeli is such a place. I order about 300 in merchandise which all have a very different ship date than when they actually did ship.  (Very inconvenient) The funds are deducted from my account and I receive my items. Then low and behold the shirts are a completely different size than what the chart says, great I have to deal with returns and store credits now when getting my money back would've been a better option for us all. The shirts I order for my job are tents and theres no way that even with a belt I can style these into being cute. The material of the shirts also grate my skin which is what I really look for when ordering shirts. So I find  a winter coat I like to spend the money I got in store credit on.  Here come the next set of issues instead of using my store credit ideeli tries to use my card and it gets declined of course because I wasn't expecting to need to keep that balance on that particular card. Then I'm told there is nothing they can or will do about it and that I just have to pony up the amount when I had nearly 200 in credits to use.  I tell them that I think this is ridiculous and that I didn't want to do that because I'd rather not give a store with such rigid policies more of my money.  Then the customer service team by email tells me they could simply reset the order and apply the credit that way.  Confused at the difference in treatment by customer service reps I tell the rep to do that and confirm that my personal account would not be affected by putting in a different card number.  Then I get no answer for three days until I send another email and find a chat specialist.  Finally I get the orders taken care of or so I think and the amount owed on the order is changed to 0.00. I think I'm done and reauthorize my card.  Then I go to buy a plane ticket for an impending trip and am declined because low and behold my account has been charged for the item I purchased.  Contact customer service told its not a charge it's a hold! Theres nothing we can do about it the other rep shouldn't have told you your account wouldn't be affected.  That will be on there for 3-5 business days and guess whats we're about to have a long weekend.  Goodbye plane ticket and trip because you will surely be cost prohibitive by the time I get my funds back! The rep continues to tell me that at the point of purchase my card needs to be authorized to verify my account. Hmmm\u2026.wouldn't the point of purchase be when the goods are exchanged for tender?? That point would have been when my store credits (which are basically my cash that's already being held captive by ideeli for a purchase gone) were exchanged internally for the items I purchase would it not? So why is my account even being mentioned in the same order when it's been paid for and internally at that.  After speaking with a rep and having my intelligence insulted when she tried to explain a point of purchase and the differences between giftcards and store credits I got on the horn and decided I'd rather spend my money on attorney's fees so they can spend their time and energy on drafting a letter to the better business bureau and I can get some much needed rest and relaxation.  Thanks Ideeli! One good turn deserves another.

VI ordered from this site and was actually pleased with the shipping, the product and the prices.  My issues began when I received a new debit card from the bank.  I tried to update my credit card information on the site and the authorization was kicked back by my bank.  I called my bank and found out that the bank will not accept transacations unless there is an amount charged to the transacation.  I understand that this is not a run of the mill problem.  But my customer service experience has been horrible,  I am to the point of wondering if they are messing with me on purpose at this point.  The first piece of advice I received was to cahnge my browser to Mozilla Firefox.  Even though I couldnt' see how my browser was going to fix the sites authorization problem, I went home and changed my browser.  I still could not update my card, why, well because when the site went to authorize the card there was no charge associated with the transaction.  So I e-mailed them and told them that I tried the new browser and that it didn't work.  So Customer Service sent me the link to update my card, this link took me to the exact same page as before and I could not, of course update my credit card.  So I e-mailed again an I was told to change my browser, again.  When I explained that I had updated my browswer and that I need to have a charge associated with the transacation authorizing my card, customer service tried to run a transacation on my old card that was registered with the site (the one that was no longer valid.. the one for which I have a replacement that I am trying to register .. ie. the cause of the problem in the first place).  When I e-mailed them and told them that the card that they tried to authorize was the old card and I needed them to authorize the new card I once again got the link to the update the credit card information page and once again could not update my credit card information.  I e-mailed Ideeli again and was told that someone would call me.  No one did.  I e-mailed again and was told that they would bump the issue up to technical support.  They did.  Technical support sent me the link to the page to update my card.  Again.  I tried again.  It didn't work again.  I e-mailed Ideeli and told them that it didn't work.  Guess what they told me to do.... wait for it .. yep .. change my browser to Mozilla firefox.  I give up.  No person there is actually looking at and trying to resolve the problem.

VOMG!  I had the worst experience ever!  You can't get anyone on the phone and live chat it not even a person.  Sound like some kind of bot and they disconnected because "it" was done with me.  How rude!  \u000a\u000aCompany placed an incorrect credit on my account.  I had no idea, thought I won something and used it.  Then they called and I was fine with sending it back.  They even sent me an e-mail with the return shipping label.  All was fine, then out of nowhere they reported me for fraud!  Ummm...excuse me!  You guys were the ones that made the mistake in the first place.  I just thought I was lucky and won and used the credit.  Now you have to nerve to call me on fraud?  Shame!  Shame!\u000a\u000aTo add insult to injury, they won't even let me have the correct credit put back on my account.  I was told someone will get back to me as soon as possible..whatever that means.  Tried to ask the rep time frame and "it" just decided the conversation has ended because other customers are in need of help.  Well, I guess I am just not important enough for them!  \u000a\u000aBuy from other sites, better shipping and prices.  I have bought from Gilt, HauteLook, Modnique, Beyond The Rack, and Rue La La and Ideeli is the worst to me.  Highest shipping price and totally riduculous care in customer service.  They don't have customer serviice...more like customer disservice.  \u000a\u000aDon't go slandering your customers when you guys are the ones who made the mistake!  Never again! Just stay away from them, not worth the time or the trouble.  You would think a company with all that it has going for it and being on top in the flash site industry would value their customers more and not lie about their own mistakes and placing blame on others.  \u000a\u000aMr. Paul Hurley, CEO and founder of ideeli.com, if you are out there looking at this...make sure your reps are properly trained and that your business standards is not about covering your own ass by throwing your customers under the bus.  This is one IPO I will not look forward to or place any stock in.

VI have been a member of this site for a few years.  I pay the extra $88 a year!  BIG MISTAKE!  The last 4out of 5 orders have been a disaster!  I have been sent defective items- clothes with stains, completely wrong items, and no items at all~ They just did not send my order!   Each time I spent about 25- 30 mins talking with a representative that really had no answers and bascically accused me of making the mistakes~  I am so frustrated with this company.  No one ever has a straight answer and "new" clothes should never be stained and soiled!  "New" clothes should be inspected and not shipped out DEFECTED!  Customer service is a joke- no help at all!  I would discourage anyone from spending money with this company!

I sent an email describing what I ordered along with the order number, as well as the other person's information.  I received an email back from ideeli's customer service saying that my original message to them was "scrambled" and if they did not have a response in 24 hours from me, they would close the issue.  I did email back, and they have not responded in their own 24 hour time frame.\u000a\u000a1. it is their mistake\u000a2. what if I did not check my email for 24 hours b/c it was the weekend?\u000a3. why is there not a phone number listed on their website?\u000a4.

VThe estimated delivery date was way off.  I was expecting a package to come in two weeks, rather than one week.  this would seem like a good thing, except I didn't keep my eye out for it, and my package was left at the post office for about a week and a half.  Additionally, the website promises UPS shipping, which is not true.  UPS ships it to the post office.  In my case they shipped it to a post office about an hour away. (very inconvenient.) I contacted the post office, and they did not even have my package! When I contacted customer service, they just said "sorry", and told me some BS about how they tried to use the postal service to deliver the packages so that it is delivered by "the men and women who know you and deliver your mail everyday".  Hello!!! I live in New York, no one, let alone the mail man give a crap about who I am and what mail I get. ridiculous. very disappointing. unprofessional, and customer service was unhelpful.

Vi needed to return two items to ideeli. Before I shipped them out, I called ideeli customer service to see whether I can ship them both using one shipping label. The lady who answered the phone said yes, so I did. After a week, I got an email saying that they have received my ITEM (singular). I logged into my ideeli account and also saw that only one item was received by ideeli warehouse. \u000a\u000aI used ideeli online chat to talk to a customer service rep who just couldn't seem to understand my point. After 10 minutes of chatting, I had to repeat for the 10th time that I shipped both one single shipping label, and she finally got it. I asked whether she could check the warehouse, she told me she has no access to it.\u000a\u000aI decided to call their customer service. No one answered. I called again and left a message. The customer service voice recording said that they'll reply to all messages within the same business day. It's almost 24 hours, still haven't heard back from them.\u000a\u000aAfter I called the customer service, I decided to use the chat again just in case the first rep was not properly trained. I was told by this new rep that multiple returns that used one single shipping label takes more time to process. Really? Why? Shouldn't the warehouse staff scan both items upon receiving them?? This just doesn't make sense.\u000a\u000aI never thought the return process of ideeli would be such a hassle. I shipped my returns using one single label to save THEM money! In the end, I'm the one who's suffering\u2026\u2026\u2026.!!!

VI wish I was allowed to give this site less than 1 star. They don't even deserve the one. Total waste of my time...\u000a\u000aNot sure what the policy is with ideeli's shipping, but they just lost a customer because of it. Ordered some dresses and a top a couple of weeks ago and noticed that only one of the items was shipped. True, they give an estimated date for shipment and don't charge your credit card until after the shipment has occurred, but still so slow...goodness!!! \u000a\u000aThe item shipped was routed from UPS to USPS, which rejected the order (what sense does it make to use UPS and then USPS??? at the same time? The shipping charge I paid on this outfit was way too high to allow the unnecessary confusion and inconvenience that ensued). I was on live chat for over an hour trying to ensure I got the outfit before this Saturday, but of course, I got no where with that. For those of you who do not know this, Ideeli does not offer a number through which to get to a human being that you can speak to and who can use their vocal chords to audibly speak to you, so trying to reason with the person I was forced to chat with was virtually impossible\u2026..person to person verbal communication was created for a reason, ideeli. Finally got a customer service number from the live chat person, but as suspected, I had to leave a message because no one picked up the phone. I was told that someone would be contacting me within 24 hours, but alas, that was not the case\u2026.I finally just got a call from a "supervisor" a few minutes ago, but it was an utter waste of time. Anyways, back to the horrible experience....the live chat person said that the order could not be sent directly to my home (huh? I would think that after paying $9.95 for shipping, receiving this item wouldn't be an issue) and that I would have to order another dress and have that shipped out again? What is the guarantee that the same thing won't happen with the new outfit? To add insult to injury, I was told that I would have to place the order myself and pay for the new price of the outfit. I then took the initiative to call UPS who was  willing to put the outfit on hold if ideeli would call them and tell them to do so, but as usual and OF COURSE, they did not do so. Well, I want to thank ideeli for the great INCONVENIENCE they have caused me. I ordered this particular dress for a wedding slated to take place this Saturday and guess what? I won't be wearing it now. \u000a\u000aBe rest assured that I will NEVER EVER patronize ideeli again and I will start spreading the word about my experience on this site. I expect to receive a FULL refund---and this was confirmed by the "supervisor" I spoke to---once they receive  the outfit that UPS had no choice but to re-send to them. UPS is less than 5 minutes from my office\u2026.it would have been really easy to run to the store and pick up the package if they would have been willing to make that call. \u000a\u000aP.S. Think of this.....Why isn't there an option for customers to give complaints and "send"? Where is the send button? Is this a clear indication that they could care less about their customer's satisfaction? Just as an FYI, no business can ever survive for long if the customer's needs are not catered to.

VA couple weeks ago I contacted their live chat correspondents to delete an extra account I have with them. They deleted the wrong one. I figured no big deal, since I figured it out appx. 30 secs after talking with support. But when I contact them right back to open it up, they say it would be too complicated, and that they can transfer my info (including a $38 dollar VIP membership fee) to the other account. I also had processed returns ($500+),  that I had yet to receive on my other account. I brought that up to them AGAIN, and the rep wants to know what the order numbers are.. I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU NEVER TRANSFERRED MY INFORMATION OVER.  Fast forward a couple weeks later and STILL NO VIP MEMBERSHIP FEE, AND I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE ANY INFO ON MY RETURNS.\u000a\u000aAs someone that has spent $2000+ on merch from this site, and someone that understands $hit happens, this is utterly ridiculous, and as soon as I am compensated, I am closing my account indefinitely.

VI ordered 2 items on June 20th. The first item is expected to ship on July 14th & the other on July 20th. Those are ideeli's guesstimates, trust me they don't have a clue. Please beware that you will not receive your items until approx  a month later. They do not divulge this info to you anywhere on their site. Their FAQ page says "Items typically ship within 14 days of when the sale closed" I emailed them & their customer service reps are inept and very contradictory. as well They then told me that he 14 days are so called "business days", unreal & unacceptable period. They also insulted my intelligence by offering me a $15 voucher, what a joke. Bottom line, BUYER BEWARE! You can find tons of other great deep discount sites tout there Several have been mentioned on this thread. If you are on the fence about ordering from ideeli yourself a favor, DON"T. It's not worth the frustration. I am already feed up & I haven't even received my order. I can't wait to see what I actually get if & when I get them.

VI use to have great service from this site until recently. I ordered some shoes and hadn't received them. Finally tracked them down and they were returned as undeliverable.  Normally they ship UPS but they changed their policy, they now use USPS.  I don't have my regular mail delivered to my home, I use a po box. On their site, you have to use a street address and they don't allow PO boxes. I contacted Ideeli and I was told to have my deliveries sent to a friend or relatives house.  I explaned I live 30 minutes away from my nearest friend or relative.  What sense does that make? Ideeli is using USPS for shipping, why not allow the customer to use their PO Box as a shipping address? I was told, they would refund my membership money but they weren't going to change their policy to allow shipments to a PO box. What an inconvenience and a stupid policy change. I know I'm not the only one who this will effect. Unless it is something I truly want, I will probably never shop their again.  Too bad, I really liked the site\u000a\u000aMary

VAt first glance this website seems a dream come true and I guess if I had read the reviews before ordering something from this website I would just have decided not to... Well I've learned my lesson and never again...\u000a\u000a1. Order 2 dresses in early May did not received it till late June\u000a2. Dresses were way to big than advertised\u000a3. I cannot exchange the items to a smaller size\u000a4. I cannot get a refund store credit only\u000a5. Brand names...???? Quality Low the only high quality are the price tags\u000a6. Paid for shipping & handling.....(endless is Free shipping, arrives within 2-3 business days and we can receive a full refund for any item)\u000a\u000aYes I would not recommend this site to anyone unless you don't mind the above...

Vin-$#*!ing-credible. not just terrible service, but DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.\u000a\u000aso, i purchase a bag from ideeli, and it arrives with the purse strap attached backwards. i like the bag overall, but i don't want a defective bag, so i contact them asking if they will send me a new, non-defective bag if i send back the defective one. they tell me that in order for me to get a non-defective replacement bag, i have to buy a new bag with my credit card - they claimed that once I sent them back the defective bag, they would issue me a refund to my card. i'm not too thrilled about putting another $65 on my credit card, but at this point i naively trust that they will do what they say, so i go ahead and buy a second bag. i mail the first defective bag back to them, and after a few days, they issue STORE CREDIT to my card. for a defective bag. i email them about it, and after a mess of emails (completely incompetent customer service that doesn't seem to understand regular english) they inform me that because i initially bought the bag with store credit, they could only give me store credit back. NEVER MIND THAT I ALREADY PAID AN EXTRA $65 ON MY CREDIT CARD TO OBTAIN A REPLACEMENT BAG. i bring their attention to this fact, and they FINALLY agree to issue me a refund, but claim that it is a ~one time special deal~ because i am a ~valuable customer~ NOT BECAUSE THEY MESSED UP THE FIRST TIME. today, i received the new bag that i purchased with my credit card. IT HAS A DEFECTIVE STRAP ON IT.\u000a\u000a1. i haven't gotten the refund that they promised\u000a2. i've emailed them about the SECOND defective bag and they haven't even had the decency to generate an automatic reply acknowledging that they received my email.\u000a\u000alike i said, IN-$#*!ING-CREDIBLE. i am definitely never shopping there again, and am very sad about the hundreds of dollars i've pumped into their scam. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

VI ordered 3 shirts a pair of jeans and my wedding gown big mistake of my life. The quality of all the items was so poor that I could have gone to Walmart and found better. The shirts were paper thin and wedding gown was the same and it was supposed to be a 300 dollars gown. Should have known better when cost of gown was only $79 dollars. Jeans were wrong size. This company is the worst online shopping experience I have ever had. They won't refund my money. They want to give me store credit now why would I want store credit when their clothes are such poor quality and I will NEVER shop with them again. Their shipping is a scam they charge you UPS rates but it gets delivered by USPS on top of that it takes them months to get your order. Stay away from this company very far away!!!

Well...I placed my order on May 1, it was never actually shipped until May 11th, & has been sitting in California since May 18th (& is still there to this day). \u000a\u000aI don't want a credit.

VSTAY AWAY FROM IDEELI.COM!!!  Ideeli is an unorganized and potentially dishonest business, stay away!  Not only did it take a month for my 4 items to arrive, then they were such poor quality and not as shown on the site.  I immediately returned all 4 and I've only been credited for 2 of the items!!!  I've followed up on this issue five times over the last month and a half, and still no credit for the other 2 items!  They say they are investigating the shipping, however all 4 items were shipped back to them in one package, and they clearly received the package because they have refunded me for 2 of the returned items!  Ideeli is completely unorganized and slow and so poor on customer service that I will NEVER use them again and hope you don't either.  The horrible customer service is enough reason not to promote such businesses, not to mention the major delay in shipping you items and poor quality of many of their clothing items.

VLet me begin by saying I have NEVER had a more horrible experience with an Internet merchant than the one I had with ideeli. I recently joined the site after watching my girlfriend buy from ideeli a few times. Last Wednesday (05/18), I placed 2 orders: the first was a Kosta Boda vase for my sister's 30th b-day, and a second order for gifts I had to make in the coming weeks (weddings and b-days). This 2nd order had 4 items in it (2 Kosta Boda items and 2 Oggi items). The 1st order was to be shipped to Phoenix directly and the 2nd one was to be shipped to me in Atlanta.\u000a\u000aLets start with order #1. On Thursday (05/19), I received an email from ideeli saying one of the items for order #2 had shipped. I went to the website to check the status of the package. To my surprise, order #2 was shown as cancelled. I never received an email telling me this. I then tried to open order #2 in my account. What did I find? Of 4 items I ordered, 3 of them had been removed from the order. The only thing that was shown was the item they had shipped (a Kosta Boda item). \u000a\u000aI contacted Customer Service via chat on Saturday (05/21) for the first time. They couldn't help me, so my issue was referred to a supervisor. I was told I would get an email explaining everything ASAP. On Monday (05/23) in the afternoon, I tried the live chat again to get an update. No update was available. I decided to send an email, as they claim they respond within 4 hours (on average!). On Tuesday (05/24), I tried the chat yet again. This time the agent told me he was going to forward my problem to a supervisor . . . wait what??? Wasn't that done already 3 days ago?\u000a\u000aWhen I got home Tuesday night, the package that was sent on the 19th had arrived. What did I find when I opened it? A broken Kosta Boda glass figure. I swear, at this point, I wanted to punch a wall. I tried calling the number the agent had given me earlier. What a joke! It went to a voicemail. I didn't bother leaving a message. I got back on the live chat, but this time I just let the agent know what a horrible service ideeli provided. He/she told me how sorry he/she was about everything (bla bla bla!) and told me I would be getting a return label for my broken item. All I had to do was put everything in the box again, tape it, drive to the post office and spend my gas money, wait in the eternal line there, and ship it back to them. After 4-5 days, I would be getting my refund. Sure, why wouldn't I do all this for ideeli, considering how great they have been to me throughout this whole experience?\u000a\u000aideeli, you are by far the WORST merchant I have dealt with in the last 15 years. Oh wait, I did get $35 to spend on a future order. Let me think about that one for a second . . .\u000a\u000aAt the end of the day, I have spent close to 8 hours dealing with this @#$%. What do I have to show for it? Absolutely nothing! Every product I ordered was cancelled or removed from my orders. And now I have to drive to the post office (on my time and dime!) so that I can get credit for an item they shipped and that was broken. Please, stay away from ideeli. My girlfriend, after watching me go thru this, has sweared she will never order from the again. Same thing with my 2 sisters. And you know what? They will get more of their friends to stop ordering from this website. Again, stay away! Customer service sucks! I even ask their agent to pass along my phone number to one of their supervisors/managers so that I could really tell him/her how I feel about this whole situation. I wonder what will happen next . . .\u000a\u000aBoycott ideeli!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

VHere's my experience.\u000aMy teenage daughter got taken in with the pictures of pretty dresses and the reasonable prices. We ordered 2 dresses and it would be about 3 weeks before we received them. She was very excited to receive them but we noticed right away that the cardboard box was damaged. What is the worst that could happen to the dresses, we thought and opened them only to find that the dresses had little holes in them and one of them had a stain. These were at best seconds!\u000aShe was quite heartbroken as she had saved up for these summer dresses and was looking forward to wearing them to school. \u000aWe called and set up a return which was painless but now we see that all we got was a store credit even though the items we received were defective. \u000aI filled out their Ask A Question form asking for a full refund and got acknowledgement but nothing more since then.\u000aMy option at this point seems to be to dispute the charge on my credit card.\u000aLet this be a warning to everyone - It is easy to set up a website with pretty pictures but you never know who you are dealing with or what you are buying. Our only defense is the credit card companies.

VI have purchased many things from Ideeli.  In general having to wait about a month for products is really annoying.  Only having 14 days (SINCE THE DAY THEY SAY THEY SHIP, not since the day you get it) is another super annoying thing.\u000a\u000aBut obviously those annoyances hadn't stopped me from shopping from them until now.\u000a\u000aIt's been over a week, and I have sent several emails and talked to at least 5 people on their chat about an order.  They say it takes 1-2 days to produce a return label... well a week and several emails and chat sessions with their customer service later I still don't have one.   Someone even called me on Saturday to say they will escalate this issue and nothing yet.  I have spent at least 2 hours with the chat representatives in the past week - and what's worse is that they just LIE to you!  They keep saying we emailed you the return label and if you haven't received it, it's probably due to filtering in YOUR email inbox.  But I found out on Saturday talking to the person on the phone that they just can't generate the UPS return label!  This is SO EMBARRASSING for a company in the e-commerce business not being able to generate a return label after a week (when they promise 1-2 days) and lying to the customer and blaming them for their inbox settings!!!\u000a\u000aI also am waiting for an order I have placed about 6 weeks ago. Part of the order has shipped a while back. One item was shipped separately and appears to be LOST!  I keep checking the UPS tracking and it seems 12 days ago it was being delivered in Seattle and there was an issue with the address!  I live in San Francisco, so I am not sure why it was sent to Seattle in the first place.   I keep contacting them about it and they say it's on its way!  Well even if it was walking from Seattle, after 12 days it would have got here!!!!\u000a\u000aIdeeli obviously hasn't got their act together and does not care about their customers after their credit cards have been charged!

VIdeeli sent me a completely different item from what I ordered so when returning the products, I was told that I would receive a refund on my shipping. 3 things that show what HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE Ideeli has:\u000a1. When I returned the items, they claimed that one of them was not in the package....absolute lie\u000a2. I had to email/go on live chat More than 10 times and have STILL YET TO RECEIVE A REFUND.\u000a3. No one EVER follows up and returns my emails.\u000a\u000aIf I do not receive my RIGHTFULLY due refund, I will be initiating a chargeback for the full amount. I SUGGEST EVERYONE INITIATE A CHARGE BACK for what Ideeli Stole from you....if you do not know how, let me know and I will show you. This is the worst site ever and considering how Ecommerce stores thrive on customer service, Ideeli is for sure doomed.

VWhile I have had some success with orders, they are usually very late and they make it very difficult to return.  They give you 14 days from shipping date to return, but it takes a week to ten days to get it. By the time you have tried numerous times to find out print out the label they tell you that you can use to return it, yougive up and send it back yourself. But by then you have passed to the 14 day return date.  Not worth it.

VThis is one of the most horrible internet shopping sites!!!!  Beware!!!\u000a\u000aFirst experience happened with my return.  I returned an item and on their website, it stated that it will take 7-10 business days.  However, package was sent nearly a month and no credits or notice via email.  So I contacted the customer service dept and they had mentioned that it will take a little longer, but didn't know how long.  Well, it was about a month.  I sent a nasty email to CSR and a rep happily accepted my return right away.  It was only after that nasty email.\u000a\u000aSecond experience happened when I tried purchasing items from a new sale that started at 4:00 pm.  I logged on at 3:40 pm just surfing to see what was on sale.  Well, right at 3:55 pm, I got kicked out of the website.  So I closed my browser and tried re-opening it.  Ideeli page came up with the site is busy, please re-visit the website in a few minutes.  That few minutes turned into an hour and half after trying to open the website 20-30 times.  It just kept going to that page stating that their website is busy at the time, to come back in a few minutes.  By that time, all the items I had wanted to purchase were sold out.  RIDICULOUS!!!  \u000a\u000aThird experience was when they sent me an email stating that they are going to give me 3 free months of First Row Membership.  So the very next morning, I woke up extra early to log on.  Well, I tried purchasing items during the the 'First Row Member' time and it stated that during that time was only for First Row Members only.  I clicked on My Account and it stated that I CURRENTLY have first row member that it expired July.  So of course, I tried going back to the sales and purchasing other items and it kept giving me the message saying I'm not a first row member.  How frustrating is that?  \u000a\u000aI don't mind not being First Row, however, if you give me that perk, please accommodate.  How could Ideeli be a business when all these things have gone wrong and they're CSR dept has just given me an email stating they will get back to me while they fix this error.  Now AFTER I had threatened to cancel my account and give them a bad review, their CSR dept had replied right away giving me a $15.00 credit.  Wow, $15 bucks!!!!  Really?!!!!  Is that all you can do after these horrible horrible horrible experiences!!  Not just once, but 3 TIMES!!!!

It is now the 28th, UPS say they delivered the package to a post office in the next county on the 22nd to be delivered to me via USPS as requested by ideeli. I still have not received the package. I emailed ideeli.com customer service twice to no response despite their 24 hour response promise, i then resorted to their online chat as no telephone number is listed. Customer representative Jessica informed me that as i have not received the package a claim would be made which will take a further 5 days, i just hope i get fully refunded and not given store credit. Considering the error is on their end i would like to be given the choice to shop there again instead of pushy store credit.

VMy experience has been great until I changed residences.  After changing my residence and updating my address at least 6 times, including updating my address every time I make an order, my purchases are still going to my old address.  All my attempts to get this situation resolved have culminated in a few condescending emails suggesting that I update my address.  I guess their customer services is dense.  I have told them that their software is not working as no matter how I update my new address, nothing takes, and the shipments are still send to the wrong address.  So 2 days after complaining yet again about the fact that they have the wrong address, they shipped again an item at the old address.  Then the said that I need to call UPS because they already shipped everything.  UPS said that the recipient has not option, but Ideeli has all the options to change an address or redirect a package.  But Ideeli refuses to do so.  This is extremely poor customer service and fraudulent. \u000a\u000aI will NEVER shop with Ideeli again.

VI got online today to see what sales were going to be on ideeli. I came across a dress I really liked. When the sale opened the dress sold out before I could order it! It says it's waitlisted. This is totally misleading. Instead of saying when things are sold out on the item page they just say that they are waitlisted! I used the "live help" which was anything but live, when I brought forth my concerns I received automated answers. How is that live help? You might as well just put together a FAQ and leave it at that. \u000a\u000aCome to find out the 'waitlist' doesn't mean that you are put in a queue for this item. They just tell you if they get more and you have to race on to try and get the item.\u000a\u000aIssues:\u000a - First Row: This is totally unfair. If I don't shop at the service that often there is no reason to pay almost $7 a month for the ability to shop only ONE HOUR earlier than everyone else. These people are basically paying to have a one-up on everyone else.\u000a\u000aAutomated Customer Service: This is just tacky, come on. It upsets people if they want to talk to a person.\u000a\u000a"Waitlist": a waitlist implies a list of people who are in line for something. It's just a mass email to those who sign up. Shouldn't it just be a notification? No item is promised and the term waitlist is defeated.\u000a\u000aThis experience was extremely unprofessional. I waited for about 20-30 minutes for this item only to find out that it was sold out.\u000a\u000aAlso, I'd like the dress.

VI'm staying away from ideeli. I had the same problem with ideeli as far as dress size. I bought and returned a dress 2 times because each time the dress fit giant on me. I received store credit twice, and lost money on shipping and handling each time. So I finally on 10/6/2010 bought a blazer/sweater, that also fit large on me, but I kept it because I didn't want to waste any more shipping money with ideeli. \u000a\u000aI spent a total of $30 in shipping costs (for the returned items and the new sweater), for one large ugly sweater that cost $36. So it would have been better for me to buy the ugly sweater at retail price at a regular store in town, I would have tried it on and found out that it looks terrible on me. \u000a\u000aIn summary, it ended up costing me $66 to try on clothes from ideeli that in the end didn't work out for me. I kept the big ugly blazer because it was smarter to keep it than to whittle down my store credit further.

VI do not recommend shopping from Ideeli.com.  There are absolutely too many other sites with a similar concept who do an amazing job.  I purchased twice from ideeli.  I canceled both orders due to late shipping.  My first order still had not shipped after 2 months after purchasing.  My 2nd order still had not shipped even a month after.  I order from hautelook and gilt and my items are shipped within a week of me placing the order  It's truly not worth the hassle to dealing with ideeli.

I would send them back, but frankly I can't risk getting my blood pressure up by shopping for inferior/used products to use up a credit as they won't refund cash.  I have shopped Rue La La and Gilt group with no issues.  I really feel taken here, but I guess Caveat Emptor--I should have looked for reviews before I made a purchase.  I was thinking of buying one of their vacation packages in the Caribbean--no way would I chance it now!

I figured it was just a glitch in the system and never bought anything. Imagine my surprise when I had 20 $1 transactions to my card for no reason. I tried calling their "customer service" line which told me due to the "Holidays" (It is almost March - they must have a huge St. Patricks Day crowd) they have a high call volume and I got transefered to a voicemail telling me to try their live chat. This is the live chat I already tried and when I brought up my issue was disconnected and no can not re-connect using my name and e-mail. So I made up a name and e-mail sh$#*!inly got through but was kept waiting for over oh wait I am still waiting 20 minutes later.

I have received from ideeli in the past month, one previously worn (and damaged) bracelet and two necklaces that I did not order and do not even remotely resemble what I did order.\u000a\u000aThe fine folks at ideeli customer service (there are rocks in my front yard with higher intelligence) promised me a full refund - purchase price plus shipping - back to my debit card.  I have this agreement in writing.\u000a\u000aToday, I get an email from customer service that my purchase price - less shipping - is now available to use as STORE CREDIT.\u000a\u000aHey ideeli, no offense, but I don't want to shop on your website ever again. So I'm going to need you to go ahead and refund the entire amount back to my debit card as you originally promised....\u000a\u000aI will post again once I have resolution.  Until then, caveat emptor!  Or shop with someone else.

As we continue to evolve the ideeli shopping experience to be the best that it can be, your feedback is crucial. We will be taking the most constructive criticism into consideration as we make further improvements. Thanks for being a part of ideeli." :):)\u000a\u000aDo not trust to this company, especially if they offer some "promo" and I can tell them now: "I don't like your promo coupon, I don't like to be in business with you ..."

VWow, I wish I have read these reviews before I placed an order. I am just utterly surprised by the WORST customer service I have ever received. I placed an order ONE MONTH ago. I still have not received the item and sent two emails inquiring about the status of my order. I am speechless by the response I have received from them that does not address the issue nor apology for the such delay. The email response stated that it may take longer wait time because they provide high quality items. I have seen the same item on Nordstrom for similar price so they are not selling items for much cheaper price. So what service are they providing better? Longer wait time, not cheaper items, and HORRIBLE customer service. NEVER AGAIN will I place an order from this website. I HIGHLY do not recommend this website, AND I will make sure all my friends know about this clearly.

VThis is the second time I have ordered from ideeli.com.  The first time, I ordered a dress, and it came quick, correct size, and I was thrilled.  I have looked at the site periodically throughout the year since then, and right before Christmas found a mirror.  I placed my order and thought I was done.  Then, a different day, I starting searching for other websites similar to this one, sample sales.  In doing this, ic ame across this site- and started reading the HORRIBLE reviews about thesite.  I was shocked!  I crossed my fingers and paryed my mirror would arrive safe, and in one piece.  First, I received the email about the 5 day delay, which I had read about.  Of course the 5 days took more like ten. Then, my order finally arrived yesterday, a month after ordering.  I carefully laid the box on the floor, and started tp slide my mirror out of the box- and the thing completely fell apart.  The glass, surprisinlgy was the ONLY thing intact.  The mirror is in shambles. After reading everyone elses reviews abouyt their TERRIBLE customer service, I decided to take it is a $40 loss and lesson learned.  I did write the customer service people, but feel it would be more headache, to pay for shipping back, and deal with this company for god knows how long.  I choose to maybe fix the mirror with a lot of glue and nails, and never, never, order from this company again.

VBUYER BEWARE. I ordered a hair dryer from Ideeli. It took a little longer to ship then I would have liked but I eventually got it and was happy with it. They then proceeded to ship me two more hair dryers I DIDN'T ORDER. Their customer service has given me the run around and has not reimbursed me for shipping these two items back to avoid being charged. It cost me $26 to ship back these two hair dryers that never should have been sent to me in the first place. This company is not professional and will screw you over!

You couln't believe this quality - your cheapest merchandise from Walmart and some 1 dollar store looks better and higher quality.

The box was ripped and poorly "mended" w/ packing tape, the knife block is filthy including dirt inside the knife slots, several knives show evidence of previous use. (Etching, etc.) Adding insult to injury -  3 knives have bent tips. No way to reach them. The deal sounded great but.... I wonder if Oprah has had complaints. Anyone else have problems w/ knife set?

The box and contents were perfectly in tact. The packing tap was not disturbed at all and all products within the box were pleasantly packed. So the issue must be that the items were never packed in the first place. I told this to ideeli , but they disregarded the facts and took no reaponsiblity. They disregarded all the facts and pinned the mistake on UPS! So UPS took the blame and eats the cost of ideeli's problems. Ideeli gets off Scott free with out a hitch.

VI am not surprised to see all these bad reviews about Ideeli. The item I ordered was not only shipped days (I am not talking about a few days!) after the expected shipping date but something happened in transit and I didn't receive anything 10 days after the item was shipped. Wondering what was going on, I contacted customer service - a few days later, they got back to me saying "the item was shipped on (the original shipping date)" ... DUH! (and no apologies or no explanation about why I still haven't received my item) I concluded it was useless to contact Ideeli again so I contacted the carrier instead. Within a few hours, I received a call back from the carrier. Apparently the package was missing the address lable that the carrier needed to contact Ideeli and get information to complete the delivery. Hearing this, I immediately contacted Ideeli asking for a refund because the item was arriving just about a month after it was supposed to and if I knew it would take that long, I wouldn't have ordered it in the first place. All Ideeli offered me was a store credit (like I am gonna deal with these people ever again!!) when they are clearly at fault shipping the package without a label....

VI have been a customer for ideeli.com for several months, starting 2009.  I agree with several of the reviews on your site that ideeli.com is not a fully trustworthy to do business with. All of their complaints are mine too.\u000aOn 11/30/09 I placed  order 4673251 with them. It consisted of  a Jessica Simpson black dress and a pair of Harahuko high heel shoes. In their acknowledgement of my order, of which I have a copy,  they stated "We expect to ship this item between Dec.16 - Dec. 22, 2009."  I emailed support@ideeli at end of December about my order and concern. I did not get a response for over a week. After my second email, they emailed me telling me that the order was shipped early December. They gave me UPS track number to confirm.  I did and what UPS stated is that yes, my order had been delivered to some place in New Jersey (their warehouse?). I was so upset! Emailed this time to their orders@ideeli.com and quoted my UPS tracking findings. I told them I wanted a reimbursement of my money in my account since they do not return your money but they put it as credit in your ideeli  account. \u000aIt has been about 2 weeks since.  I have not heard from them and, when I went to My Account Shipments, a list of all your purchases, order numbers, date you ordered, etc, I found all info abt. my order has been errased except the order number and date of order. To the present time, I have not received an answer to my last email, have not received my money back and they have basically stolen my money and tried to erased everything about my order!  What can I do???? I AM A VICTIM OF FRAUD by Ideeli!!!

On January 6th, I hadn't received any shipping notification so I sent an e-mail to their support and was told that the coat would ship in the next 24 to 48 hours and they'd be happy to apply a shipping waiver.  I waited another 3 days and sent them another e-mail to which I received a reply that said, "Our warehouse team informs us that this item from your order is unavailable from the manufacturer."  Did they not this two days prior when I first inquired?  It had practically been one month since I placed my order.  They gave me a one-year $25 credit as a "courtesy".    \u000a\u000aIdeeli fails at the very basic level of a business: supplying products that they advertise.  \u000a\u000aWhat upsets me so much is that the coat was a present for my future sister-in-law.  How terrible does it look; I say it's coming between x and y dates, oh no wait another 2 days, and oh no, it's not in stock?\u000a\u000aI will never do business with them again . A $25 credit does not put a coat in my future sister-in-law's hands.

VOk. Does this website/company even stock any products? I see their ads ALL over google. They say they have 1 million members. Well YEAH, who wouldn't if you blanketed Google and Yahoo with ads for months and months. Fine. So I place an order and I get my package 2 weeks and 4 days later. Is this a joke? Wrong item. No customer service. No returns? Not even a store credit? I'm going to be diplomatic \u2014so read between the lines: AVOID! As a side note, Ideeli says it's invite-only. Really? This seems like an oxy-moron.

VI just cancelled my ideeli account this afternoon after received their horrible customer service. In Thanks Giving period, I ordered more than 12 items from this website. It took them more than a month to deliver to me. No email, no notice, worse - they cancelled one of my item which I wanted to give to my friend without letting me know. I complaint to the customer service, they told me that they put $25 credit into my account (again, without letting me know). I went to my account and thinking of getting this $25, and it already expired. ENOUGH is ENOUGH! I love the products in ideeli.com, but I can not take it anymore!

VHORRIBLE.  I purchased two items from Ideeli.  The first item took about a month to arrive - even though their policy is to ship items after 10 days from purchase.  \u000a\u000aThe second purchase was WORSE.  After almost 3 weeks I contacted Ideeli about the status of my item.  No response.  Finally after about 4 emails they responded and stated that my item was out of stock.  I asked if they ever were going to notify me that the item was out of stock.  Silence.  The only responses I received were cut and paste responses from their stockpile of responses.\u000a\u000aNEVER again.  Do not buy from them.  Horrible customer service.

VI used to order in Ideeli before, and did not know it takes around 3 weeks before they start delivering or worse even more than month before you get the actual product. Well that is still not the WORST. The worst part is that when you received the wrong product or the product you ordered is NOT what it looks like on the pictures (wrong color), when you return it, it takes one week to ship to their warehouse and up to now, I kept emailing them after 2 weeks of delivering to their warehouse (UPS tracking said it was already delivered), still I DO NOT have my credits back. Its really a shame... I will NOT RECOMMEND this website to anyone!

VI have shopped with some of the other online sample sale websites and always been happy. Ideeli, however, sent me the wrong sized item (a 10 versus a 2), then attached a sized  2 tag of their own to it. I am in the process of attempting to return the item, and it is nearly impossible. No one replies to my emails and they only offer store credit, minus the shipping costs. So I will end up paying 10.95 for shipment of an item that was not what I ordered.

VI like to buy designer apparel with great discount! So, I decided to try ideeli.com,I've heard about it lot from my friend. I bought 4 items there and I payed the whole amount of money. But next day the returned me some money,less than a half of the sum,as they had sent only two items,and two was in a wait list. But when they charged us,everything was in stock. We had been waiting for a month and finally the sent those two items and they charged me not that sum,which they had returned me,but the whole sum again. I wrote the support team and they promised to help me in 24 hours. It has been already 2 days nobody answers me. It"s awful!!!

VI have been using ideeli for several years now. It the beginning I was pleased. However, the past several orders have been poor experiences so I am not sure what has changed there.  The short window for returning an item is not reasonable. I travel for my job and as a result, have missed the ridiculously short time frame for returns. Recently, I bought a set of a luggage that was a killer deal based on the make. Or so I thought. I used the carry on ONE time I did not check it. The wheels broke, the handle unraveled  and the piping unraveled. The online chat rep told me that I had to work with the luggage manufacturer to get a replacement set. Uh no thanks, it was junk, I just wanted to return it and get a credit. No, they say. I gave a second piece of luggage from the set a try during a second trip. Hoping it was a fluke. The driver picked the bag up to place it in the trunk and the handle completely broke. At that point it was laughable how bad the product they sold was. Even if I wanted to really shop with them now, I can't as the site is not loading and that's been the case for three days. Glad I am paying a membership fee for poor service and a site that I cant access.

VI''ve been ordering things online from Ideeli from past two years. Recently they have added this new shipping feature that is if you buy something for the first time, you will have to pay $9.95 once and get free shipping throughout the next 30 days. Few months ago I had ordered a couple of things the first time I received the shipment on time then I wanted to make use of the free shipping feature and ordered something that was delivered after a month of the expected shipping date. I assumed it must be the manufacturer/inventory issue that must have caused the delay so I didn't care much. but then on one of my recent orders Ideeli has shipped the package through UPS which then was delivered to USPS but its been a month since its been with USPS and they haven't delivered it yet, I've contacted Ideeli, UPS, USPS and nobody seems to know the where about the package. I am about to move from my apartment soon so I really don't know when should I expect it t be delivered but I know one thing for sure that henceforth I am not shopping with Ideeli ever again.

VI have had what seems to be the common experience with ideeli lately.  I have been a loyal customer of ideeli for years and really value the convenience and quality that they have provided in the past.  However, I have made three orders in the past 4 months and EVERY order has been a mistake.  The wrong item, size, or color.  It is not convenient to receive an item just to have to return it.  However, I must say that I have had good experiences with their customer service, they always provide me with a full refund, shipping label, and credit to ideeli.  Although why I'd want to use a credit to order what will turn out to be the wrong item is beyond me...

VAwful, disrespectful fulfillment department. As if people there are constantly under whatever influence. I won't go in depth but, believe me,  it's absurd.\u000aBilling is also very peculiar: credits don't show up weeks at a time, of course it means more profit for the owners. There are no email or other notifications for the transactions, tracking your payment/credit balance is practically impossible.\u000aOut of stock items still shown as shipped, eligible for return items marked as NO in package slip..\u000aUnless you are a pro in accounting don't make a habit buying at ideeli.

VThey sell some good designer brands. However, the quality of merchandise they sell is a lower quality than you would find in a store or on some of the other flash sale sites like Gilt. Generally, fabrics are cheaper and the colors shown on the website, compared to what you receive, are off. This is known as a classic bait-and-switch. For example, what is shown on the website as a lovely turquoise arrives as a hideous dark mint green and gorgeous black and white abstract racer-back top shown with stark white pants, arrives as a black and dirty beige which looks odd with white pants. They have a good return policy - free shipping for a store credit - but you wait up to 10 days for the credit to show up in your account which is not good since they have your money and you are now out of money with nothing to show for it. Lately, I find I'm returning more than I'm keeping. The fit is also a little off compared to the size chart they show. My advice is shop at your own risk; some days you may be luckier than others with what you receive compared to what you ordered.

VCute stuff, good deals, but most websites I use have free shipping and I receive items usually within a week. I placed an order for 4 pairs of sandals on the 20th of June, I was shocked when it said that the items will be shipped between 11-17 July. Summer in my city doesn't last very long! I should have just canceled the order at that point. Anyhow, on the 15th of July, one of the items is shipped. The rest still not shipped even though its the 18th. I asked customer service and they say the rest of the items will "most likely" be shipped today. Never going back to this site.

VI have been a customer of ideeli for a few years. Now that I am studying for the bar I have started shopping there more as a pick me up. Up until recently my experience had been good.  In early June I placed an order for 6 Mikasa dinnerware sets in various colors (red, black and orange). I received them and liked them so much that I decided to order 2 more sets. I ordered one in black and one in orange. They arrived but when I opened the box both sets were black.  I emailed Ideeli and they told me that the orange was now waitlisted.  I online chatted with a customer service representative, Robert, who frankly I found rude.  He was unwilling to extend my return date so that I could keep the black long enough to see if I could get off the waitlist. While I wanted the orange set I didn't want to return the black and ultimately not have a complete set. of 8.  He said and I quote: " The only thing I can suggest is to contact us when you feel you have waited long enough if the other color does not become available." It was off-putting especially since this was the company's mistake. \u000aLuckily 2 days later I receive an email saying the orange was available again so I quickly ordered it.  I then proceeded to pack up the black set and take to a UPS store (because the box wouldn't fit in a UPS stand) and returned to Ideeli.  Yesterday I received my new order, open it and its ANOTHER black set!! NOT orange! I was furious. This time I got a nicer customer representative, but equally ineffective and unhelpful.  To make matters worse, the company no longer has the orange color.  It's mistake now cost me the item I wanted! The customer rep gave me a $25 credit, which was nice but given the $9.99 shipping you have to pay it doesn't amount to much.  I have decided to keep the black set, but I find the whole process disorganized, unprofessional, and the customer service in dire need of training.  I used my credit, but the company has lost me as customer. Do better!

VI have spent thousands of dollars on Ideeli over the years. It was my to-go-to place for a bad day at work. I would be glues to my desk at 11:00 AM, I mean don't call me. Recently I have noticed that the quality of there clothes have deteriorated. They have some good sales every once in awhile but it's mostly terrible. Where are they getting these ugly clothes from? Did they change their buyer? It has gotten so bad, I've gone from checking everyday to deleting the App from my phone. If I want ugly clothes I will go to Sears....On the other hand I have never had a terrible experience with shipping. It's always right on time. If you could just get good stuff, maybe I will be back.....

VI have always loved Ideeli and never imagined that I would one day have to write a negative review on the site. I gave the site a '2' because i cannot deny that their product offerings are great, but their customer service is one of the worst i've ever experienced. Here is what happened:\u000a\u000aMy sister and i both shop at ideeli and since I am visiting her, I shopped at Ideeli with my credit card (CC), and used her address for shipping. After I had placed my order, I immediately got an email  from ideeli saying the order had been cancelled due to fraudulent activity, but they wouldnt tell me anything else. And when I emailed the fraud prevention team as the email had recommended, no one got in touch with me for two days. So I went ahead and re-ordered the items, and again they canceled the order without explaining why.\u000a\u000aWhen someone finally called me over the phone - 4 days after, they said that they could not ship to my sister's address anymore because the address had been associated with fraudulent activity <---What?! I buy 80% of my stuff online, and never have I heard anything this ridiculous. I tried to probe further, but the rep, Stacy, said she could not tell me 'why' they couldnt ship to the address anymore, but she welcomed me to continue shopping with ideeli. Well, how exactly was I supposed to shop, since the address I was staying at had been blacklisted? I even handed the phone to my sister, since it's her address, I thought they would give her more information. But again, they just said that they could not ship to the address anymore and that was that.\u000a\u000aHere is what I think is going on: ideeli flagged the order because they noticed that a different CC had been used for a shipping address on a user account they had on file (my sister's). Kudos to them for catching that! that's what security systems are for. But then, instead of putting in some extra work to verify the order with my sister, or with me, they simply blacklisted the address because two different CCs had been used. That is just lazy, and extremely terrible customer service.\u000a\u000aI am very disappointed with ideeli for this, and especially with the tone that Stacy used on the phone. She basically told my sister and I that we could no longer shop with ideeli. I'm sorry ideeli, but i find it extremely unfair that you would have your customers pay for system flaws on your part.\u000a\u000aDisappointed!!

VI have been looking at this website for a few weeks.  First, I don't see the big price advantage to most of the items.  You can come close to matching their price by doing some homework searching on the web.  Secondly, and the most negative for me, is that to have the "privledge" to order some of the items on their site, you must pay an ongoing fee to join a subscriber group to purchase these items.  They bill you up front and take your "dues" so that you may have the privledge to perhaps find something you might want to purchase in the future.  In this economy, when all retailers are fighting for a piece of the consumers money, why would anyone agree to pay for the privledge to be given an opportunity to buy something?  This is absurd and particulary aggravating since their site has nothing particularly special or at a deeply discounted price.  No way!

VI had a bad experience from the get go.... I saw 2 pairs of pants and a pair of shorts that I really liked. I ordered them right away. Well it took about 2 or more weeks to tell me my order was going to ship out. (All 3 items) Last minute they told me they made a mistake and could no longer ship my the shorts. And I gave them the second star ONLY because they did give me a 10 dollar credit to their site for the inconvenience. It only took mmmmm... a month or more to get my order. I finally got to try them on after a month!! They were to big :( Not a big deal, it happens!! But I had a vacation I was going on out of state and I was not able to return them right away. Once I was back and able to return them it was to late I guess. So now I'm stuck with these pants that are to big for me and I don't know what to do with them.... I just want my money back. I don't even care if they charge me a fee.... I just don't know what to do with these things!! Anyone want 2 cute pair's of teal and pink pats size 9?! Haha. ..

VI wouldnt recommend this site for the simple fact that when you purchase an item, the order will be processed, you will see the money come out of your account, yet they may not ship your item in a timely manner and they will suddenly charge your account (possibly TWICE) when the item ships. In my case, I purchased an item in March, it is now April 27 and I just now saw that the money was being taken out of my account for this purchase. Fortunately for me I had enough money in my account but I would much rather have the money come out of my account WHEN i make the purchase, and then have my item shipped, rather than have my account billed whenever they choose to ship the item. The deals on this site really arent anything to write home about so this will be my last time doing business with them. Oh well.

VI really really wanted to give them a 1 star but I'm trying to be fair. So I'll start w/ the POSITIVE: - Sometimes they have better prices for identical items seen on Gilt and Ruelala.  \u000a\u000aUnfortunately the NEGATIVE outweighs the positive:\u000a-Sales are not as good as on other sites (lesser known brands and I rarely see anything I like.)\u000a-Items take a long long time to ship. Sometimes up to a month. \u000a-Shipping is more than on other sites $9.95 (enough to deter me from buying something if there is only 1 thing I want).\u000a-Shipping, coupled w/ customer service is just terrible. Items sell out and no one tells you so you get a package w/o half the things you ordered and you have to research why.  I ordered something recently and they just decided to redirect it from UPS to USPS and I had to go to the post office to pick it up. Except I had it shipped to my parents' and I don't live there and they can't pick up a package for me at the post office because they are not me (and you need ID to pick stuff up). Also, I just paid $10 shipping for regular mail when I was told it would ship UPS. \u000a-Their website is SLOOOOWWW or sometimes doesn't work at all. I've gotten way too many errors when trying to use their site. \u000a-The real kicker for me is customer service. I mean it is just beyond terrible. I had emailed them w/ a problem, and they told me one thing. Then I waited and received nothing. So I chatted w/ customer service via their chat and was told they'd refund me. That never happened. So I chatted w/ another customer service rep via their chat and they were totally unhelpful. I had to give them info. They had no idea what I was talking about. I had to copy and paste emails and former chats into the chat, then they put me on hold for a while until they could figure it out which they never did. And then they would not even compensate me for my inconvenience as a courtesy. They said they don't operate that way or something. (FYI, Gilt gave me a $10 credit just because I wanted to buy something that the site told me was available but was sold out). I tried calling the customer service phone # and had to leave a message. BTW no one has called me back. \u000a\u000aHonestly, so not worth the hassle. My last order will be my last. And the only reason I placed it was to use a store credit I had so I never have to shop w/ them again. Use Gilt or Ruelala instead. The sales are better anyway.

VI received an item ordered, however the size was too small and I wanted to speak with someone and see if an exchange for a larger size was an option. I first tried their live chat on the website, however it does not connect. I then tried their customer service phone number, however there was never a representative available to speak with me. I left several messages and no one ever got back to me. Because of the non existent customer service I probably will not shop from ideeli again. It's unfortunate.

VIdeeli is unreliable and extremely shady.  You never know if you will actually get what you pay for. A month ago I ordered several things that arrived at my doorstep 3 weeks later. When I finally got the package, I discovered that they sent me the wrong item and yet it was labeled correctly with the correct description.  While I know mistakes happen, this really bothered me because it seemed extremely shady. First of all, why did I receive a random item that I didn\u2019t order instead of the dress that I paid for?  And why was the LABEL correct? It's like someone intentionally did that hoping maybe I'd forget about it or something.\u000a\u000aAfterwards I contacted customer service expressing my frustration, and she said that the item was out of stock. Hold on - they had THREE WEEKS to let me know this. Instead, they send me a DIFFERENT item with the correct LABEL, so maybe someone should have known that maybe these two thing don't match?? I could think of so many other business practices that would have been better than what ideeli did.\u000a\u000aI had $39.99 in store credit from a previous purchase which I returned, opting for the store credit instead because I planned to use it in the future. However, after this incidence, I asked customer service to fully refund that credit now that I am never buying anything from this site again. However, they instead decided to give me the refund with return shipping deducted, essentially stealing more of my money.\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve purchased with no issues in the past but I have literally stopped going on the site completely ever since this problem.  I am not going to let ideeli steal my money again.

VThe products are ok, once you finally get them.  However, they do a weird thing with their shipping in that it starts with UPS, but instead of UPS just delivering it to you, UPS delivers it to your local US Post Office, who then will deliver it (if you're lucky, unlike me this time) the next day.  I'm not sure why they need that extra step in there or why they can't allow us to choose the delivery, but it is annoying when it breaks down.  I am currently waiting for a delivery that was supposed to be delivered by USPS on Saturday.  I waited ALL day for the delivery and it never came.  I looked at the USPS track and confirm site later that night and it said that they made a delivery attempt AND left a notice!  WHAT!?!?!?!  I was at home then and they didn't come!  They didn't leave any delivery notice either.  So I then tried to find where the package is today and was told it was at a local office waiting for me to pick up.  I go there and they said they don't have it and it was "still on the truck", but they couldn't say whether that meant they would try to deliver it again today.  So I contact Ideeli to complain and the CS person acted like it didn't really matter that I'd wasted my entire day Saturday and all morning today dealing with this!\u000a\u000aIdeeli, you need better customer service who at least act like they care when you've wasted so much time dealing with these problems.  I will likely never buy from there again now.

VIf you enjoy paying $18.00 for the privilege of trying on ill-fitting merchandise, then returning it at your own expense, this may be the place for you.  But I'd have to be a masochist to continue shopping here, when I can go to a great discount retailer near where I live and try on as many items as I want for FREE.  Just received two uncomfortable not well tailored items; paid $10 for shipping and was forced to pay $8.00 to return, since you cannot return the way you choose, and you only receive a free return if you agree to park your money at Ideeli (how convenient for them!) in the hope of repeating the process some time in the future.

VI have to agree with other reviewers....sometimes great products and good prices, but what does it matter when you never receive the item you ordered?!! I ordered a watch that was for some reason non-returnable...in the picture, it looked small, was not listed as a man's watch....on a site that sells mostly womens things, i never thought that what i received would be this large, bulky mans watch that I will never wear!!!  When I inquired about returning it as it was not properly labeled, I was told it was non- returnable! $160 down the drain!!  In 2010 I ordered a set of bamboo bowls...two or the five bowls arrived, after quite a delay. I waited awhile to see if the others would come before contacting customer "service". When I finally did, I was told I had to return the bowls I had received to receive a refund...they were out of stock of the other items I had ordered. But I wanted the bowls, I'd ordered them for a reason!  Despite being on the phone w the cs woman for quite awhile, she still couldn't understand the concept of refunding me for what I didn't receive. I was flabbergasted when she said that I would only be refunded for the portion of the order that I sent back!!! I yelled How can I send you things I never received!!!! What an idiot!!! I ended up keeping the 2 bowls & eating my loss. Incredibly terrible customer "service". I'm SO glad to see I'm not alone...if I had known it wasn't just my bad luck with ideeli I would've made a bigger stink!!!

VI was a member of the ideeli website from 9/26/10 to 3/3/12. My loyalty was not rewarded. Although I was happy with ideeli for the most part during this time period, you never know about a company until you experience your 1st major problem. Unfortunately ideeli  would rather sacrifice a client that purchases on the site on a weekly basis and pays for 1st row membership than do the right thing. \u000a\u000aThe problem I encountered is a result of a shipping issue which ideeli has been aware of for months but has not resolved. Some items are shipped with a tracking number but the link does not provide any tracking information and the shipping service instructs the customer to contact the shipper. When you contact Ideeli they explain they are unable to track certain shipments. The customer is instructed to recontact them if the item is not received after 10 business days. At this point they will initiate an investigation which will resolve in another 8 business days and based on the outcome the customer may or may not receive a refund. This tracking issue happened to me once before but I received the item so my trust in purchasing from Ideeli was maintained.\u000a\u000aBack to incident at hand.. I received an email with a tracking number indicating my package shipped on 2/16/12, but as of 3/3/12 there is still no tracking information available and I have not received my item. I was charged $39.99 for the item plus $9.95 for shipping. \u000a\u000aNow I am waiting for an additional investigation over the next 8 business days to find out if Ideeli decides to issue me a credit for the item I haven't received. \u000a\u000aI live in a house in a well to do neighborhood in Boca Raton and I have never experienced a delivery issue (mind you I shop online almost daily). \u000a\u000aI can't believe I am waiting for an investigation from the shipper that never provided tracking information in the first place. It is shady and what is worse is that Ideeli continues to use this shipping practice on certain  orders fully aware of the tracking issue. Even worse is that when an item is not received Ideeli penalizes the customer and does not refund the purchase. I am beyond disgusted and disappointed. \u000a\u000aIf my item is not delivered or refunded after the end of the 8 business days I will file dispute with the better business bureau, post on every blog site I can find, and open a dispute with my credit card company. It is unacceptable to charge a customer for an item not received. In fairness the charge should be changed to pending until the matter is fully investigated. I can't believe my long and steady purchase history did not result in better service. Ultimately Ideeli should offer excellent service to everyone, but one would hope established loyalty would be worth preserving as well. \u000a\u000aDue to this terrible experience I have 5 items received over the last week, all being returned. Another on the way (with tracking) which will be returned. Another 3 items that haven't shipped, will also be returned- assuming I actually receive them! And of course the 1st row membership scheduled for renewal tomorrow has been terminated. \u000aI will never give Ideeli the opportunity to treat me this way again and I will do my best to warn others.

VI ordered a skirt and top from Desigual on January 27th (Order Reference: 38955622) as a gift for my daughter for Valentines day.  After I ordered I saw the ship date was February 13th.  I was disappointed that it wouldn't arrive in time but I told my daughter her gift would be late this year.  Well, its March 3rd and I still don't have it.  I received a message on February 15th that it shipped with a tracking number.  I tried tracking the package but each time received a message that there was no tracking information on this package. On Feb 23rd I wrote talked to someone by live chat.  The person I talked to by live chat told me that the problem with the tracking numbers is a "known" issue that Ideeli has with their shipping company.  She said to wait 10 business days and contact them again if the package didn't arrive.  When I complained that it had been a month since I ordered it she gave me a $10 credit to a future purchase.  I waited the 10 business days and contacted customer service again Feb 29th asking for a full refund on my purchase.  They said they would open an investigation into what happened with my package and get back to me in 8 business days!!!  That will be March 12th.  So I have been charged 100 bucks for merchandise I order January 27th and I'm to wait until March 12th?  I am a frequent online shopper and frequently order from Rue La La, Gilt Group, Bluefly, Shopbop, etc.  I have never ordered anything where I was billed and 6 weeks later had no merchandise.  I will not be ordering with ideeli again.

What got me is the response to these reviews have come MONTHS later!!! Poor reflection of customer service, and an inferior company who needs to establish better social media performance.

VThis is my 3rd Order with ideeli... I love the idea of membership discounted shopping sites. The product and pricing that they offer is amazing, but compared to there competitors GILT and Rue LaLa they've got a lot to learn about customer service. I know that the only way most of these sites are able to offer such a deep discount is by cutting overhead, but when you'er frustrated the last thing you want to do is speak with someone via a chat, or email! It may be antiquated but having a customer service phone number would probably add half a star to your rating.\u000aIt also would hurt if the service reps that you did speak with via chat / email were empathetic to your issues. No once during my 15min chat did my rep take ownership for their substandard service.... Unfortunately this will be my last order from this site... GILT & Rue La La have me for LIFE!!!!!!

Vi live in NJ. NJ does not charge tax on clothes. i purchased clothes from ideeli, shipping to NJ. no taxes should be charged. i was charged for taxes.  i had "live chat" conversation with a customer service rep.  first, she just said they charge taxes in NJ. um, well, that's not OK. when i persisted and asked why, she had no explanation, but offered me a $10 credit to shut me up.  all good and well, i'll take the $10 credit, but why are you charging me tax on exempt items and are you going to continue to charge taxes, particularly when i go to redeem my credit?  her answer was to ignore my first question and pretty much confirm that they will continue to charge taxes on clothes to NJ shoppers, including myself.  she told me my only recourse was to basically complain every time it happens.  at least, she was honest. sure enough, when i went to redeem my credits, i was charged taxes.  i will now go to complain.\u000a\u000amoral of the story: if you live in a state that does not charge taxes or does not charge taxes on particular items and you make a purchase at ideeli, pay attention to your invoice to see if you were charge taxes.  if you were charged taxes, complain until they give you a credit.  otherwise, you can wait until down the line there is a class action lawsuit and get some minute fraction of a huge settlement. #shrug

VI put myself on a waiting list for a dress and they emailed me to tell me that they have it back in stock. I placed the order right away along with some other items. Well everything shipped but the dress. I was planning to wear this dress for New Years Eve and I placed the order on Dec 6th. \u000a\u000aA week later I contacted them they said that they were waiting for the vendor to ship them the dress. Why would you sell a dress that you don't have in stock? And why would you email me to tell me that you do have it in stock.\u000a\u000aI checked again 2 weeks later and they told me that they aren't shipping the dress because it didn't pass quality inspection. They were apologetic and gave me a $25 credit. \u000a\u000aThe $10 shipping is pretty steep. I don't know why they ship it to the post office and then have them deliver it to me. \u000a\u000aI probably would use them again but only if I see something I really like.

VI am long-time Ideeli shopper who is about to throw in the towel. This time last year, the monthly red sales were the highlight of my weekend; I looked forward to them during the week and spent a ton of money every time they rolled around. The first few purchases went incredibly smoothly and I was very pleased with the site.  The problems started happening about 8 months ago. I purchased a beautiful Calvin Klein suit that was covered in small dirt spots upon receipt; it appeared to have been dropped into mud and not cleaned. I bought another suit at an amazing discount that I was very excited to wear. When I received the suit, it was not anything like what was pictured. I emailed customer service (who always has responded to my inquiries without problem) and was sent a return label and told that I would either be sent the suit I purchased if it was in stock or given a refund. I was disappointed when my money was refunded, but I completely understand some small mishaps (not as many I have now experienced) and limited quantities on sample sale sites. To my chagrin, the exact same suit was then offered on the next red sale after I was told it was no longer in stock.\u000a\u000aOn top of these, I bought a pair of jeans and received the wrong size, bought two Sue Wong dresses that turned out not to be Sue Wong at all, but the value brand of her line, Studio SW, bought two of the exact same Jessica Simpson dresses and was sent the exact same wrong one with both purchases, and received two dresses with defective zippers.\u000a\u000aThough all of these are disappointing, I can expect some disappointment when you can get things like Jessica Simpson dresses for $8-20. But when you add to these disappointments an increasing stock of decreasing clothing quality plus much higher prices, the incentive to shop on Ideeli is diminishing.  Ideeli used to have tons of dresses with MSRPs between $130-170 on sale for as cheap as $6. Now, more often than not you see dresses priced between $60-$80 for $25-35 on the red sales and think fast sales. The quality of the clothes on Ideeli is way down, yet the price is up. However, other sites offer better quality clothes at much greater discounts weekly without the need to pay $80 a year.\u000a\u000aI really enjoyed shopping on Ideeli and would love to see it return to its former glory. It used to be a wonderful site, but now it just brings along disappointment.  Furthermore, if a customer service rep replies to this, instead of just telling me that you are sorry about my disappointment, please do something to fix it because Ideeli used to be my go-to site and I would like it to be again.

VThis shopping venue is very so-so at best.  \u000a\u000aIt has a nice selection and at fairly good prices, and so I find myself looking at the selection frequently, and yet I rarely purchase.  Why?  Because shipping is $10 and takes a month or longer.\u000a\u000aSince shipping is so expensive, I'll find a product for a good price but then think "oh yeah, add $10, and the price is no longer so great..."  And then the fact that the shipping is so unreliable and takes so long, you can never really shop for a specific occasion, like a party, because you can't count on the dress arriving on time.\u000a\u000aNot only that, but always check for the item, particularly the home good items, on other sites first.  I frequently find them offered on amazon.com also, by doing a simple search on froogle.com (a shopping comparison search engine) and find the product offered for roughly the same price.  And of course then I have better shipping options.

VIdeeli has poor customer service. They lost my package that was a holiday gift, and instead of sending me a new one, they told me it would take 8 business days until they could even begin issuing a refund. What's the point of a holiday gift if it comes after the holidays? They sent my package surepost, which gives you absolutely no way of tracking it and I had to be the one trying to track it down. You would think they would be more considerate of the fact that it's a holiday gift and at least issue an instant refund so I could get a gift somewhere else. Also, it's a little ridiculous to spend 10 dollars on shipping for a method which doesn't allow you to track it.

VI've spent over $1500 on nearly 40 items over the last year from Ideeli. The more I deal with them, the less satisfied I am. \u000a\u000aTo begin, the site has a lot of label overlap with other sites like Hautelook, but without the value.  You can expect to pay at least 30-50% more for the same item at Ideeli. Also, there's a lot of redundancy.  I've seen items regurgitated several times over the course of a few weeks with little to no price change.\u000a\u000aQuality control is horrible from site presentation to shipping and customer service.  I could go into a lot of detail concerning the fidelity of the images on the web-site (color, sizing, etc.), packaging (ripped, destroyed packages really; inadequate tape; bundling items to skim on shipping charges; dumping to Post Office for delivery; high $10 initial shipping charge), slow response to e-mail inquiries, failure to respond accurately to return requests, inadequate inspection of merchandise for sale (like delivering pink underwear that's described and shown as very red), damaged items, wrong items, mis-labled items.\u000a\u000aIn particular, my last return involved several of the above issues all rolled into a prime example of how poorly this company executes.  I ended up paying $40 in shipping for return items that didn't fit, were damaged, or not what I ordered.  \u000a\u000aThe bottom line is that this company doesn't measure up to the competition, and there's no reason to do business with them. Once my store credit is used, I'll be adding them to the spam filter.

VI have to say, pretty poor experience.  My package was "delivered" when it was not actually delivered, and the response from customer service was to contact the USPS 800 number and give them my tracking number.  Great.  So someone in some call center nowhere nearby will tell me it was delivered, just like the notification says...even though it wasn't ($75 dollars later....).  Pretty poor.  Probably going to cancel my membership.

VI never received my shipment from ideeli, even though it was 'delivered' according to UPS tracking. The customer service gave me generic responses for nine days and in the end, all I receive after a "technical team investigation" is that the order was delivered - "Please let us know if you want us to contact the shipping company". Seems like they did not see my complaint at all - the shipping company should've been contacted a week ago!\u000aI have bought from ideeli before and have received shipments on time and the products were satisfactory too.  This is the first time I had to contact their customer service and they were very slow and unsatisfactory.

VI have ordered three times from this site.  Apparently, that was two too many.  My first ordered went fine.  I then ordered a sweater and sunglasses from the site, and it has been well over a month.  Still the items have not been delivered.  The delivery was suppose to be completed by now, but the status simply says that UPS was directed by ideeli.com to hand over the shipment to the US postal service.  How can that possibly make sense?  Ideeli.com has no way to actually speak to a customer service representative, the live chat support is useless, rude and not helpful, and I've sent an email which has yet to receive a response.  I made a third order shortly after the second, and neither order has shipped.  I do a lot of on-line shopping and will not use this site again.  A customer should have the ability to speak to someone live if necessary.  A customer should also be able to get items on-time, as promised, especially since its the customer who is paying to ship the items.  The only reason this site got two stars is because the selection and prices are great.  However, you purchase items at the risk of getting them whenever they want to ship them, with no recourse whatsoever, or not getting them at all and having to deal with your credit card company.  Overall, its a huge disappointment.

VI was so excited to use ideeli because I have had such great experiences with Rue La La and ideeli seemed to have more options and more daily "boutiques". So when I ordered my first purchase, I didn't expect to have a negative experience.\u000a\u000aI ordered this transformer dress and I was so excited for it, until it came. The material of the dress is horrid (which I can't really blame ideeli for since they didn't make it, but they are selling it), but more frustrating is that they didn't include instructions on how to tie the dress to make the abundant styles that were shown on the website. Without instructions, I have absolutely no idea how to make any styles with this dress. I looked on the website and saw that previous buyers had also requested instructions months ago, and yet there are still no instructions. Further, the dress is just kind of crappy. Not only the material, but since I got a patterned version of the dress, many of the styles I've attempted to make mean that the panels look awful since the pattern is only one-sided. And, the dress is see-through. \u000a\u000aI've decided to return the dress, which means I'll get store credit and which means that ideeli gets a $10 donation of my money (used for shipping), that I don't get back. Now, I know that shipping a dress does not cost $10. I have paid that much for shipping on Rue La La but was never bothered because I've never returned anything because everything I have ordered was WELL MADE (because, if this transformer dress were made really well - I would probably keep it, even without the instructions). I've never been dissatisfied with Rue.\u000a\u000aAdd to that, the friend that recommended ideeli to me recently bought a watch on the site. Within 2 weeks, that watch had fallen apart. So now I'm extremely hesitant to order anything from the site except that they will only give me store credit for the return. Ugh. Well, I've learned my lesson. I get to spend $50 credit on something I don't really want (because, if I wait, I'll forget about the site and the credit) and ideeli gets a $10 donation of my money because they sell a crappy product. Awesome. Definitely would not recommend ideeli.

VI have been shopping on ideeli for months now and generally the experience was ok, they have pretty good selection of stuff, eventhough like some of the reviewers here mentioned, the sizes are not always consistent, but that is more the brand's fault for not giving them the right size charts. \u000a\u000aOn the whole they are a little slow in shipping and I didn't like the fact that one time I paid for shipping on different days of shopping, but they lump the shipments together when sending it out to me, meaning they saved one shipping fee on the order and yet did not pass that savings on to me. I do not think it is right to stiff someone on their shipping fees when they try to save money by lumping all your orders together. \u000a\u000aBut apart from that, the biggest problems I have to date are their customer service. They are very slow in processing returns, the customer service people can basically tell you nothing if it has not been 10 business days after they receive the items, not even an update. And when I was chatting with a customer service rep the first time, they actually disconnected on me the minute I wrote 'that is it for today.', chat etiquette is such that you never disconnect on the customer. \u000a\u000aNow the biggest and latest problem I have to date : A few weeks ago I bought a pair of Dr Scholl's boots.. the shipping was delayed, for which they apologized, but when it did finally arrive a few days ago, it was the wrong color! \u000a\u000aI immediately went online to tell the customer service that and unfortunately now my size and color is out of stock! So I even told them I will accept 1/2 size up, figuring I could just put some padding in the shoes, and at that time, that size was still in stock. I asked the customer service rep if she/he could hold it for me while I make the purchase or if I can just make a new purchase then and there, and they said no, they will send me a special link in the email to 'repurchase' it. Of course, then it took the email one day to arrive, and by the time the link arrived, the shoes were completely out of stock! I have never seen a company been so stingy with helping the customer before, how hard is it to reserve the pair of shoes or to even process the exchange then and there?!  Express shop had sent me a pair of wrong size pants and when I called their customer service, she immediately had the correct size pants shipped out to me there and then on the phone, just to make sure it didn't run out. And I returned the wrong pair of pants the next day. That is a so much more efficient way of handling things. And when I email support@ideeli.com to complain about the problem, they just said there is nothing they can do (in a nice way of course), and that 'their products is on first come first serve basis'. Come on! If they had let me buy the next half size up when I first contacted them about the problem, I would have been first in line too! But they won't let me, i had to wait for that slow email and click on the 'special link' and they didn't even have the courtesy to 'reserve' the shoes for me for that link! \u000a\u000a  I have spent a lot of money in ideeli for the past few months and now I am so angry I am not going to buy their stuff anymore, their customer service has to be overhauled and they have to change the way they do exchanges, instead of the inefficient, roundabout way they do now. I am going to see now how long it takes for the money to be returned to me, since it is completely not my fault the wrong shoes were sent to me.

VI'm annoyed with Ideeli.  Their return policy isn't very good - if you don't like something then usually you just get ideeli credit.  I ordered two Calvin Dresses on there and it took a while to get them, and then one didn't fit.  Of course, I got an excellent deal on it and it was unreturnable.  That's disappointing.  \u000a\u000a  And, I just ordered three toys for my nephews birthday (two weeks in advance!) and they aren't going to be shipped until October 6th!  That is 5 entire days after his second birthday party.  Great, now who looks like the bad Aunt just because she wanted to save some cash on Melissa and Doug stuff.  \u000a\u000aAnyway, I think I'm done with Ideeli for a while. I'm just not impressed with the savings I get for the amount of hassle it is to actually receive my packages.  \u000a\u000aOrder #31717658

VI've been a member and have bought several items and have recommend it to friends as well. For the most part they've been good until I had to return some earrings I bought for $54. The earrings were broken. Of course I was going to send them back. So they issue me a credit. I would have preffered my money back but okay they want to keep you purchasing from them. So with my credit I buy some shoes that were $38. I get them and they run too small so I have to return them. They issue me a $29 credit. I finally go check my account with Ideeli only to come to find that my original purchase of $54 CHARGED TO MY CREDIT CARD and paid... has only granted me a $35 of credit with Ideeli!!! So I paid in full $54 and have not kept any merchandise and have returned everything due to damage or wrong size only to get NOTHING and have only $35 in credit. Is this ROBBERY? YES. Is it illegal to take my money and have no goods exchanged? YES!! Will they at least return my $35 as a refund, NO!! I must and have to keep my money (so called Credit) with them in their account. For what? So I can purchase something else and give them another $10 in shipping.. where in the end the $54 I spent ..$30 of it has been spent on shipping and I've received and kept nothing. Why not just refund my money and stop ROBBING your loyal customers????????????????? I'm so disgusted with their so called policy. I have a credit account that slowly diminishing and I get nothing in return. GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!

VIdeeli has cool stuff, however I ordered 2 items and 1 shipped right away (3 weeks ago) and the other just shipped this week.  We just moved into a new house and now that my item is finally shipping it is going to my old address.  When I contacted Ideeli to update my shipping address for this item they said they could not change the address because the order has to go to the same address and the first part of the order already shipped!  We have renters moving into our old house, so now I have to arrange to get my package when it comes in.  And the jeans I got that shipped right away did not fit, so I returned them....so now I have a credit and I have not desire to buy anything.  Do not recommend buying from them, the whole process and policies are a hassle.

VThough I have accounts with other sale sites as well, I usually end up ordering items I see from ideeli because they tend to have the lowest sale prices.  However, they also take the longest to actually ship after an order is placed (at least a week if not a bit longer), shipping costs $9, and they ask UPS to ship your package to your local post office which then takes another 2 days to ship the package to you.  My last purchase was ordered July 10, was not shipped until July 25, and I did not receive it until August 4.  To be fair, when an order is placed, the website does tell you the expected ship date - and it is pretty accurate.  Even though the merchandise is usually a good deal, paying $9 for shipping that takes forever is frustrating.  I would only recommend ordering things from ideeli that you don't need to have immediately.\u000a\u000aAs for sizing issues - it is very hit or miss.  I ordered 2 dresses, both smalls, and only one fit when they arrived.  It makes me wonder if the sizing chart is really from the clothing manufacturer or a generic sizing table from ideeli.\u000a\u000aMy conclusion is this - you get what you pay for.  I have always received my orders, and the merchandise has always been intact and new, but I'm not sure that is really cause for praise - that's just saying the site isn't a scam.  Thus my rating of 2 stars out of 5.

VI have been ordering from Ideeli for almost a year now and generally had a good experience. I've always loved the stuff I've ordered, returns have been fairly easy, etc. The first thing that made me go "WTF?" was when they emailed me and said that a pair of jeans I had ordered from them could not be obtained, yet they proceeded to put those same jeans in the same size up for sale twice after telling me that. I didn't want to try to reorder them. Regardless, up until last month, I was a satisfied customer of theirs. So much so that when I saw the Ravon convertible dress sale, I encouraged my best friend who is getting married this summer to consider those dresses as bridesmaid dresses for us since we were less than two months to her wedding and didn't have our dresses figured out yet. She agreed, so we all ordered our dresses on the same day (6/8) and they were to ship before 6/30. Well, on the 1st of July, mine finally shipped. One of the other girls had gotten hers the week prior. About a week passed from that, and my best friend was starting to wonder where the other two girls' dresses were. She contacted Ideeli on live chat, and they essentially told her something like, there are no more, we can't get them, and definitely not before the 30th (her wedding date). She was SO upset and she was freaking out about what we were supposed to do for bridesmaid dresses for two of her bridesmaids now. So I got on Ideeli's Facebook page, thinking I could ask them on there and they could give me some insight as to how this could happen. I saw that they quickly responded to all things posted on their wall. Turns out, they responded to everyone else's inane and pointless posts but never addressed my question to them, which I found ridiculous. So basically, we had to find two other dresses, that will not match as well, for the other two bridesmaids. Now I'm wishing that I would not have suggested Ideeli in the first place, since placing an order with them apparently means you may or may not get your item, which is unacceptable when it's something as important as a bridesmaid dress. Oh, and I saw on their Facebook page that they're having another Ravon sale later this month (I thought there were no more Ravon dresses left?). So that's cute. Based on the above, I'm not planning on buying from Ideeli anytime in the near future.

VTHIS IS A MUST READ IF YOU NEED TIPS ON GETTING WHAT YOU WANT FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE SERVICE / TIPS AND INFO ABOUT SAMPLE SALES\u000a\u000aThis is a second review, about tips for sample sites.\u000a\u000aI posted a review alittle earlier about a problem that I'm having, but that problem couldn't have been avoided. I gave this review 2 stars because while the problem I have puts ideeli at a 0, my past experiences have been a 4. So. 2 is a happy in between.\u000a\u000aHere's some tips\u000a\u000aCANCELLING AN ITEM:\u000aYeah, it sucks you only have an hr to cancel an item. But I mean.. no big deal, you can return it. If you have a problem, you should have read the order confirmation where it says YOU HAVE AN HOUR TO CANCEL THE ORDER. Sure you lost 10 bucks for the shipping/tax fee, but maybe that will teach you to pay attention next time. Another thing; will you guys stop crying about the "$10 shipping fee"? It includes tax, and you can shop all day and they will all be in the same order so you're only being charged one time. Isn't that better than paying individual tax on the items?\u000a\u000aSHIPPING:\u000aOk guys.. first you need to understand how a sample sale works. Sample sales are usually when a retailer has items they want to get rid of, and so they first sell as many as they want, and then sell in bulk to these sample sale sites. So while they purchase said items, they won't have a confirmed amount or date for them to sell them until they have sole all the ones they want to. ideeli has to wait until retailers sends them the items before they say they can repackage them themselves, and ship them. That's... responsible? How would you feel if they said it'd ship in the regular 5-7 business, days, only to get it 2 weeks later because they didn't receive the merch from the retailers until a week prior? \u000aI'ts comical to read some of these reviews saying "I ordered on July 4th, and it's the 11th and I haven't gotten anything." First of all, it's 5-7 business days. Saturday and Sunday are not business days. Second, they let you know the expected ship date (READ THE ORDER INFORMATION!!!) ; most times it won't ship until that date. If you have a problem waiting a month for an item; easy solution: DON'T ORDER IT? They have always shipped in in the expected date window, and most of the time, it's been before. You have to understand how sample sales work.\u000a\u000aFAILING TO RECEIVE PACKAGE EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS DELIVERED:\u000a I've had a couple problems with receiving products (lost by the post office, totally not ideeli's fault), but they've always taken care of it (issued a full refund back to my card). If your package gets lost, they're very helpful as well. Contact them by the live chat, and at the end of the convo, ask for an email containing of the reference number of the claim, a transcript of the convo for your reference, and save the conversation yourself just incase. That way they can't say "we don't have records of your previous inquiry. They have a 8day policy for claiming a lost package, and by the end, they will refund your item back to your card. This has happened to me a couple times. You have to follow up alot, but in the end it gets taken care of. \u000a\u000aRETURNS\u000aAs far as returning, they have a very small window to do so; 14 days after the SHIP date, not the ARRIVAL date. So what I do is, if I am unsure an item will fit, or if I'll like it or not, I go ahead and start processing the return, before I've received it; this gives you more time just in case because you have already started processing, and have the label, ect. And if you end up changing your mind, no worries, just keep the item. \u000a\u000aEXCHANGE\u000aOk.. it's a sample sale guys.. because the prices are so low, and they have a limited amount, items go fast. They don't have the luxury of making merchandise; they get surplus from retailers. So it's common sense that they'll not have a size or item for you to exchange. However, every once in a while, they have blowout sales, that have repeat items (I'm thinking these are items that have been returned, were on wait/hold list but never purchased, or just items that weren't sold). Check those out; usually they have the same items even discounted more; but they go quick\u000a\u000a\u000aROW 1 MEMBERSHIP:\u000aGet it. They have sales not available to regular non paying members, you get to shop an hour early.. ect. If I can get it transferred to my new account (hintJASONhint) that'd be nice. \u000a\u000aGETTING PROBLEMS TAKEN CARE OF:\u000aOk guys.. this is self explanatory. "You catch more flies with honey". I wish you guys realized how easy it is for someone to give you the run around and not help you if you're rude. You need to be assertive, but polite. Please and thank you go a long way, and try not to talk down. Remember: they're helping you. Make sure you ask for an email of the transcript of the convo, and then make sure you save it yourself. I learned this very quickly; otherwise, they won't document your claim, and you'll have nothing to show for your conversation. Stay on their asses. They won't follow up with you, you have to do so with them. Sucks, but what are you going to do. \u000a\u000a So all in all I've had good experiences with them, it's just this past one that's alittle enfuriating, but Jason seems to be taking care of it. Hope this helps.

VI have had multiple issues with this site and thought at last the issues had been resolved, but they keep happening.  Where do I begin?  First of all, a dormant site which had not been used in a year was opened when I logged in (not by any prompting of mine) and then placed an order not realizing it was my "real" account.  The account was closed after I received the order and alerted customer service I wanted to return the items.  However, when I sent the dresses back, they sent them back to me as I don't have access to re-print the return label anymore.\u000aAlso, I was just charged an additional $9.00 for shipping on one item that was backordered and should have been shipped on the initial order.  Now I feel I have to go back and check each order to see if I have been double/triple billed on the shipping charges!!\u000a\u000aGet it together Ideeli!!  Giltgroupe charges $5.95 for shipping all the time, once per order!!!\u000a\u000aJanet

VFirstly, i used to have a great experience with IDEELI until yesterday.\u000a\u000a#26395659: I receieved this package and something is missing. I reported it, i still havent heard from them yet.\u000a\u000a#26719627: This was cancelled due to failure to authorize since i am overseas, i cannot get my card at home in the USA to authorize it. I am on a business trip right now, so i didnt realize what was happening to my ideeli account.\u000a\u000aThe online chat staff Jessica has an attitude and after talking to her for 15 mins (very frustrating convo), all i got was sorry the items are not available anymore. WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME IN THE FIRST PLACE!? \u000aAren't the staff suppose to help u buy things and not trying to stop you or making it REALLY difficult? AND the online staff blamed it on "the situation being confusing".. NOW THAT- is confusing!\u000aI really like the stuff on that order and it just make me angry because I am a customer and a fly to be shooed off.\u000aI wish there is MORE flexibility and understanding. More listening then trying to NOT help customers and stop being robotic and have some human element and compassion in their customer service.\u000aI work for a magazine and i will make sure this is told to other ppl. i found this site and it is great research.

VI understand the type of business ideeli is in - limited supply, long shipping windows, restrictive return policy. Get it.  My order actually shipped much earlier than stated so kudos for that.  Unfortunately I received the wrong dress.  I am in the distribution business so I understand a lot about orders and mispulls/shorts.  That being said - since this was my first order from ideeli, I've received a 100% service failure.  In my business 100% service failure equals permanent loss of business.\u000a\u000aI logged in this morning and chatted with a customer service rep who was accommodating but in my opinion you could tell they handle issues like mine all the time and this wasn't something new.  (Jason - incident #110505-000\u200b138).\u000a\u000aThe return UPS label was emailed immediately (kudos again) but I still want my dress and I want ideeli to make this right.  I'm eligible for a full credit card refund but I hope I receive my product.  The quality assurance process is lacking and needs to be redone.  I personally have a 98% operational service level with my customers and I expect nothing less from the companies I buy from.  We'll see how this ends...

VI have to agree with some of the reviews here about how it takes Ideeli a really long time to deliver merchandise.  But the last purchase I made, I ordered a beige dress and it was gorgeous. When I received it, it wasn't beige....it was a light grey color. I reviewed my order and saw that I did, indeed, order the beige color dress. The light grey color wasn't awful, it just wasn't what I ordered.  By that point I had already removed the tag and I thought it would just  a big hassle to return and I needed a dress for an occasion. I think the site has really great deals and some of the things are really nice....but I may use it less frequently.

VIdeeli has got to be the dumbest company ever, regarding customer service.\u000aI have spent $15,000.00 since Jan (that's $5,000 a mth).   They sent me a size 10 boot, instead of what I ordered a size 6.5.   I sent them an email, they said return the item (even though it said non-refundable/ because it was the wrong size sent)  \u000aGreatly appreciated & what they should say since it was IDEELI's mistake.\u000aFastForward:\u000aI've returned the item (THEY HAVE IT NOW) and they won't credit me.  So it's a $49 boot, I've spent $15,000 in under 4 months and they are arguing with me over the $49 credit.\u000aRisk loosing a $15,000 customer over a $49 boot, you betcha.  I returned the boot, and yes I will take my business else where this is ridiculous.  It's about customer service, and I DID what I was suppose to do.  IDEELI CAN"T/ OR WON'T.

VAs a longtime sample sale shopper, I had high hopes for Ideeli.  I've ordered from Gilt Groupe, Rue La La, and Haute Look, all of which have impeccable customer service, so I was very stoked to find a beautiful dress that had been sold out for ages (it was past season) on ideeli for a fraction of its retail price.  Even better, it was only on sale in a 4 and a 12 - after obsessively refreshing for a while (someone put the 4 in their cart), I was able to snag the size 4. \u000a\u000aAfterwards, however, I mentioned this purchase to a friend - another longtime sample sale shopper - who seemed surprised I had taken a risk with Ideeli at all.  So I went online and found all these terrible reviews - slow shipping, nonexistent customer service, wrong items and sizes sent, sometimes even damaged.  I was extremely wary, but there was nothing I could do.  To my surprise, the item shipped nearly immediately despite an expected ship date of 3 weeks later so I thought maybe I had just gotten lucky.  Wrong.  The dress arrived yesterday - in a size 2.\u000a\u000aNow I have the option of trying to hassle with customer service - and there is no phone number, so you are at the mercy of whenever they feel like responding to your emails - about exchanging the dress, except I'm not even sure they have it in the right size to begin with.  Why would they list a 4 and a 12 if there's also a 2?  2 was not even an option!  So that leaves trying to get a refund, which from what I've read is another hassle in and of itself.  I may just end up keeping this dress and dieting to fit into it.  (eyeroll).\u000a\u000aAll in all, not the worst experience ever but I imagine if they had sent this to me in a 14 and I needed to return it they would've offered store credit or something of the like, if I managed to get a hold of them at all.  If you want a safe consumer experience where you receive the items you order, stay away from Ideeli.  There are plenty of better sites out there.

VAfter reading reviews, I was quite hesitant to shop through this site but I decided to give it try anyway. So, I placed my first order yesterday. Everything went smooth from adding the item to the cart to making the final purchase. I even had few questions which were wonderfully taken care of through discussion board as well as privately. My issue was with sizing. I bought a dress in size 40 which according to the size chart was small. Today, I logged on to see any updates to find out the SIZE CHART HAS BEEN UPDATED. Now, size 40 is a Medium instead. \u000aI have emailed and also, posted on discussion board but no one has reached out to me yet. I am hoping someone will reach out to me ASAP so I am not shipped the wrong size because it was definitely not my fault and I definitely do not wish to be stuck with such a large amount of store credit. \u000aI was hoping I would have something great to say but I really don't until this situation is taken care of. \u000a\u000aReetika

VI've shipped with Ideeli for years and have finally decided to spend my money with Hautelook.com or Gilt.com. I've placed many orders that Ideeli has been unable to fulfill, at which point they offer a credit for the inconvenience which is appreciated. However, a month ago I placed an order for a leather jacket - I was especially excited about this order as if had my eye on it in a store a few months prior. I first was notified that shipping would be delayed and issued a credit for the shipping ($10). Then I was notified they would be unable to fill the order and issued a $15 credit. I appreciated it. However, today (less than a month later) I noticed the same jacket, in the size I ordered, on sale again. However, it sold out before I could purchase it. I sent an email to ideeli and was told the item had been returned from the original sale. So, not only had they filed someone's order other than myself the first time, but when that person sent the item back I was not even given the opportunity to purchase it. They offered me a $10 voucher, but I will not take another chance on ideeli. at least with other sites I know I will get what I purchaser!

I sent an e-mail yesterday night to Ideeli asking for you guys to change the size before to send it to me. \u000a\u000aBut now, that I already read all these bad reviews about Ideeli I am afraid that I will have a bad experience as well. So, here is my message for you Mr. F: If you really sorry for all the mistakes Ideeli did to all these costumers, here you have the opportunity to fix a problem before it comes. I am sending you this message in a public web because I want make sure that YOU will take care of what I already asked. If Ideeli do not give an answer immediately, I will come to this web again and let people know the continuation of my story. \u000a\u000aIf something goes wrong, I do not want to see a message from you here saying the same thing you said to all these people: "I apologize, I apologize..." If it happen, then it will be more than clear that you just apologize but you do not really move a finger to help anyone.\u000a\u000aThat is my order number: 20468415\u000aThis is my incidence number:110223-000715\u000a\u000aAppreciate any help.

VI'm ready to throw in the towel on this one...\u000a\u000aMy first purchase was a dress, it was a fair price, shipping time was okay, and I loved the piece! I was very happy and raved about the company.\u000a\u000aMy second purchase was a set of lenox towels: the towels arrived but the wash clothes and hand towels did not. The company told me I could return the item for their review -- huh? Let me go out of my way to return an incomplete order for what? Them to tell me I secretly kept the matching wash clothes and hand towels? I counted my losses on this one and didn't fight it.\u000a\u000a\u000aThen just the other week I decided to buy some lingerie since V day is coming up. I got an email saying they didn't get in one of the items and apologized and gave me a $15 credit. ok, thats fine. Then the other piece came in and it was missing a garder strap. Seriously?! So now I have a non-returnable item that won't even hold up my stockings. Not to mention that I'm also without the very item I wanted to have on Valentines day -- had I received the other item, this wouldn't have been as much of an issue. \u000a\u000aAre the deals good? yes. \u000aAre they worth it? probably not.

VI ordered from the top 3 sample sites this holiday season (Ideeli, Rue La La, and HauteLook).  I ordered from all 3 a couple days before Christmas. Rue La La impressed me the most thus far.  I had my package by Christmas Eve!  Had my post office been open I would have been able to have the gift for Christmas, but I happily picked it up the next available business day.  The dress was great and I was impressed.  Ideeli arrived about a week after I placed my order.  Not too shabby.  Once again, the dress was as described, HOWEVER, I also ordered a watch and the color on the website looked RED.  They sent me a PINK watch.  I nor my daughter wear pink.  So we had to take one for the team on that.  As it was non returnable.  I have yet to even have my package from HauteLook even shipped!  So they come in dead last. \u000a\u000a Regarding Ideeli, the fact that their return policy is so strict, I can't continue to be a customer.  I am deleting my account as of today.  The lessoned I learned is to do business with companies that are about TRULY pleasing their customer base (ie ZAPPOS).

VThis site  appears to offer high quality goods at discounted prices. Unfortunatey, their customer service is beyond awful.  If there is a problem with an item ordered  they qualify themselves  up the wazoo in terms of whether they will issue refund for defective merchandise, promise to send return shipping labels, and weeks later they have done nothing.  once i WAS able to locate their actual telephone number (888-835-1719), and a harried-sounding gentleman finally answered said they were really swamped... (maybe they should hire more help?)   they rarely actually answer the phone.  when finally you reach someone, they tell you that they will get to the matter the next day.  But they don't.  they obviously have a lot of preparation and money invested in setting up this business and site; I hope they got on the ball sooner rather than later with their customer service issues or they will be out of business before they can again say "we'll get on it tomorrow..."  too bad.  for those they've offended, they should offer future discount coupons or free shipping or some kind of appeasement.  but nothing is offered but arrogance.  their items look good, but the whole shopping experience with them has been an unneccessarily frustrating and aggravating experience.  i  .

VPretty bad, especially when compared with similar sites like Gilt & Rue La La. Ordered an item and was sent the wrong thing, which while I felt was intentional, (as despite item being available on the site, they said my item was 'sold out.' It seemed they thought incorrect item was one I might keep.) I wasn't too worried about, except that they don't offer cash back, and by the time you have the item delivered via ground and then returned, you run the risk of being outside of their window for creating a credit. Additionally, it was pretty terrible customer service and the whole operation seems fairly fly-by-night. Will not try them again.

VI made a purchase from ideeli of two Margaret O'Leary sweaters.  There was no problem with the order or with the return of one of the sweaters (for which I got a store credit).  The sweater I kept has been disappointing as the linen picked so badly afer one wearing it looks years old.  The one I returned was returned because it's construction looked like a factory second.\u000a\u000aI then purchased a creme color Da Nang silk tunic to use the credit I had.  Again, no problem with the sale.  However, upon opening the box (which arrived within the time stated) I was very surprised to see the ugliest color tunic, which resembled the picture in stye (with differences) but is nowhere near the ivory color shown in the picture. In looking back at the order it did say Gold tunic but I just assumed that is what they were calling the ivory color (and if this color is gold it is a very badly burnished dirt/olive/gold).\u000a\u000aI didn't write after the first experience but just felt I had to now.  So I am again going to have a credit which I will have to use.  At $10 shipping every time I order I am now regretting my expereince.  My advice - although the site doesn't say it please be aware that you are probably getting factory seconds which are flawed in some way.  Either that or you will get an item that is similar to what is shown in the picture, but not necessarily the same.  I would not receommend this site to a friend.

VI have no problem with their customer service...I bought one item and received it before the "expected shipping dates"...my problem is with some of the prices...DO YOUR RESEARCH ONLINE before you buy to make sure you're getting the lowest price. A couple of weeks ago they had a French Connection dress that was selling for a lower price on the French Connection website...and today they have a corso como sandal that is selling for a lower price on the corso como website (and the designers are offering free shipping)...I sent customer service a message about this, and they just thanked me for my thoughts! So, at random I decided to research another item on sale, Donna Karan black slide ons (on sale now)...and its selling at endless.com for about $35 lower + free shipping!!!! All I'm saying is...do your research. I just saved about $15 by buying the sandals from corso como. Maybe with higher end products (e.g. Gucci, etc.) their deals are the best...I don't know.

VI ordered a dress from this site, it took much longer than the estimated amount of time to be shipped to me.\u000a\u000aWhen I opened the box, there was clearly a large snag in the fabric of the dress, which had been shipped in a plastic bag.  This was directly under a Quality Assurance tag. I don't know who's checking the quality of these products, but they need to have their eyes checked.\u000a\u000aI got a credit for the dress, but not my shipping, which is terrible customer service.

Vi totally disagree about their customer service. I send them an email and i get responses within an hour or two from initiatng the request, and  I receive any follow up emails within minutes of writing replies, I actually really appreciate that about ideeli. What i do not appreciate is that the majority of stuff i get is damaged(usually only slightly, but it's almost everything i get from them), i don't think it's their fault, it's probably the merchandiser trying to pawn off their damaged goods for whatever they can get for it, but it's offensive that ideeli allows it to happen. \u000aPlus, despite the 2 week waiting period before shipment, I often get an email saying they need another extra week to ship it, and then when i email them a week and a half later they say they won't be shipping me the item at all. I can understand that happening once in a while, but in the last 2 weeks, 3 or 4 items from totoally different companies have been cancelled by the ideeli, after almost a month of waiting for it. I don't have the time or patience for that b.s., especially now that their are plenty of other similar sites out there.

VI love how they offer designer items at a discount.  However, their customer service is nonexistent and they don't adhere to the shipping schedules promised on their website.  I ordered a $200 handbag which did not ship until a month after my credit card was charged, despite their FAQ, which says "[w]e may take up to 10 business days from the close of a sale to ship... Please don't contact us to find out what your tracking number is until at least ten (10) days after a sale ends."  No one responded to my repeated emails, and the customer service phone number goes straight to a machine.  I finally got the bag, but it was the end of the season, I already purchased another bag at a retail store, I was really frustrated with ideeli.com, and I had almost filed a complaint with the BBB.

VI had the same experience as other reviewers.  I purchased several items that were shown as returnable but when I went to return them, they popped up as non-returnable items.  I did contact customer service to ask if I could at least return the items for a store credit which they did.  I would have preferred a refund which I didn't ask for as I was worried I would be stuck with the items.  I thought there would be a better chance of a store credit than a refund.  After reading some of these reviews, I will be following up today to verify that I received my credit.   I recently ordered a pair of non-returnable shorts in a brand I am familiar with.  I ordered the size I usually wear in that brand but they didn't fit.   Since I knew they couldn't be returned, I'm stuck with a $50 pair of shorts (plus $10 for shipping) that I can't wear.   Probably won't  be ordering from Ideeli again.  There are too many other good options.

VUpdate: After shopping with Ideeli for another year, I've noticed some changes to their 'tactics.'  I had my first encounter with a relatively condescending customer service rep. who answered my questions functionally but seemed to have an attitude.  My question was if they shipped items earlier than the estimated shipping date because in my experience, they've tended to do that.  The answer I received was "[Name], you've been a regular customer of Ideeli.  You know the way it works.  Nothing has changed."  Actually, a follow-up question I would have had was if they could notify customers if shipments were going to be early (I have random stacked credit).  Functionally, it would saved a lot less attitude and characters if the rep had just said "We try to ship around the estimated dates but yes, sometimes."  Less typing, you know --- energy conservation.\u000a\u000aI think something happened with merchandising as well, they have less interesting designers featured.  They've rotated in higher luxury brands like Gucci, Prada, etc but in general - they tend to rotate the same-ish style merchandise that I find not appealing.  They've also reduced giving out a $25 credit for items that are out of stock to $10 shipping credit.  They removed the discussion pages for sales and instead implemented an instant chat system.  These aren't terrible changes, more neutral and one of the positive things is that I do like their home/kitchen/living sales and will probably only check those out.\u000a\u000aThe bottom line is that, with other flash sale sites gaining a footing with consumers and establishing merchandise audiences it's getting harder to standout and keep people's attentions.  Ideeli has maintained a relatively reliable service with shipping items and good billing practices and I've personally never used their travel deals, but they do try to keep it 'interesting.'  But for me, it's no longer fun and mostly generic.\u000a\u000aIn general, I've had decent experiences with Ideeli.  Their items have arrived a few days before the estimated shipping dates and the items themselves are definitely new.  I've had an order cancelled once because it wasn't available but received a $25 credit.  Slightly disappointing but it wasn't a must-have item.\u000aI have had to return dresses 3x, I've ordered 2 dresses each time to compensate for the shipping.  The first time the dresses mostly fit, but just wasn't suited to my body shape.  The other two times, a brand's manufacturer's chart listed an M as 4-6 but ended up being a bit too big (the next size down, 0-2 wouldn't have made sense since I've never been a 2 even at my thinnest).  The other brand had bust, waist and hip measurements which sort of matched mine, but still ended up a bit too large.  I'm not sure if the manufacturers aren't competent enough to create an accurate chart, if I don't know my own measurements but I agree that trying on dresses for up to $30 can add up.  That being said, the other stuff I've gotten were good deals so it kind of offsets this annoyance but I'd be wary about ordering clothing unless you're relatively sure it'll fit.

VI've purchased on this website very often. The reason I continue to come back is because their prices are hands down the best of all of the flash sale sites that I've shopped at--especially their red sales which are fantastic if you are a bargain hunter. However, if it weren't for the great prices I have to be honest and say that I would not shop here nearly as much mostly because of the quality control. I'd say about 25% of the orders I place end with me receiving the wrong item or the wrong size--I'm not even exaggerating that number. On 3 separate occasions, I've reordered items that I had returned only to receive the exact same item I had just returned to them. One time I received the wrong skirt--but ended up liking it better than the one I purchased! I'm pretty sure that they do not check what you mail back to them before shipping it back out to the next unwitting customer. Live Help is a toss up--I've received extremely nice and helpful agents and not so nice ones--so if you aren't helped with one person try again. There definitely are people who care that work here--you just have to find them. If you have an issue that prompts live help agents to say they will get back to you--ALWAYS follow up with the same question to their support email--because I never tend to receive follow up from Live help agents whereas I always do from email. I have had orders canceled also and have received $25, $15 or $10 vouchers as an apology-- not quite sure how they decide which vouchers you will get. Although I am disappointed--their vouchers keep me coming back to order something else that I like and I find that most things that end up canceled show up on their site at some later date so you have to keep checking back.  Regarding shipping--9.95 is steep if you only want some small item but it really is great that they let you shop all day with the flat price where most sites only let you purchase so many items at a time. Plus, you get 2 hours from the time you purchase to change your order--no other site does that. BOTTOM LINE: The best site for deals, the worst for quality control so if you go in knowing that you may not always get what you paid for but are very grateful when you do (I've scored some awesome items for practically nothing) then you will enjoy ideeli. If youre willing to pay more for better service--Gilt may be more your thing. Orders will be canceled and wrong items will be sent, but you'll always get your money back with a little persistence with customer service. They really need a phone number--I think that would go a long way.

I'm sorry folks but when you spend $500 you should get FREE SHIPPING.  In case Ideeli missed it, new deal-a-day shopping sites like MyHabit are sprouting like weeds and they generally have either free or cheaper shipping than Ideeli.  Get with the program, Ideeli!

VMy issue with Ideeli is a technical one but I won't start on a sour note: Ideeli has some fabulous deals and I think their return policy is reasonable and fairly easy.  One time I needed to return an item, I had exceeded the amount of days allowed to return because I was out of town.  I will say that they were not responsive over email.  I googled "ideeli" and "phone number" to find their actual customer service line.  After leaving a few messages, someone got back to me and they happily agreed to take back the return as a one time courtesy.  Now if I have issues or questions I just use their "chat" option. Someone is always available w/ an answer.  I think customers have to realize this isn't a huge operation like Gilt where you might get a response more quickly but the items are more expensive.  Now for my real gripe. One day I logged on and the images just didn't show up when I clicked products. The "chat" rep informed me that the site does not work w/ any search engines out of date.  At work we have to use IE 7 because some of the apps we use are not yet compatible w/ IE 8.  To me it's ridiculous to have a site that goes on sale at 11:00 and not make your site accessible to many who are at work and have locked down settings.  I really hope Ideeli fixes this soon because I won't be buying anything from them until then.

VI like ideeli. The items are always sent out on time and the dates of shipment are clearly listed when ordering. Yes, sometimes orders take weeks but you can't complain because the dates of shipment for each item are listed under the price. It is up to the buyer if they want to wait that long. Ive found some great deals and some good quality pieces, everything has arrived new and in nice red wrapping paper. I had a few issues which were easily resolved by talking to a customer service rep. They're $9.95 monthly shipping charge is very fair if your a frequent shopper, however I wish they offered 2 shipping options, a one time $5.95 or monthly 9.95---that would be awesome! Also, sometimes they advertise red sales but the items I recognize from earlier in the month and at the same full price, I find this deceptive. But I do realize ideeli needs to make $, just dont advertise it as a red or closeout price when it is not.

VI have been using this site for almost two years and have placed many, many orders.  I have had all good experiences.  I have returned many items as well and never had a problem getting a full refund.  You have to be careful placing orders, because some items are not returnable.  There are the two things that annoy me about the site.  The high shipping charges and the fact that they have certain things you cannot return.  If something does not fit you, you have no need for it at all and it is a total waste of money.  And certain things, like bathing suits, you really need to try on to see if you like. Regardless, I love the site and will just never order bathing suits or nonreturnable items.  Great deals.

VI have ordered from Ideeli numerous times, and after reading the complaints here cannot imagine that we are talking about the same website. This site has been a pleasure to order from: Ordering is easy, I find many things I like (at good prices), and they are very clear about whether something can or can not be returned (and all relevant policies) at the point of sale. The *one* time I had to return something beyond their 14-day limit, I believe I'd recleived the package while we were out of state on vacation for two weeks. I explained the situation, and that I did not like the purchase, and got a response authorizing a return. I was pleasantly surprised that they made this exception when they clearly did not have to. Also, I enjoy getting the free VIP shipping that they reward frequent buyers with. Having to accept credit on returns is no problem, as I know I will be buying from them again and again.

VGenerally speaking, I have been an ideeli customer for quite a while now, and have made numerous purchases. There have been a few issues with shipping, but they were resolved in the end after conversing with customer care.\u000a\u000aThe clothes I've purchased were always pretty true to the photographs and descriptions. Sometimes the fit is still a little off, but 9 out of 10 times they fit as expected and I end up loving my purchases. There have been some great finds in the home section as well. \u000a\u000aI've noticed the selection goes from really good to pretty "meh." Some days I have to try really hard to whittle down the items in my cart, but there are times where I browse everything and nothing looks that great.\u000a\u000aI've also made several returns, each was completed without too much trouble. I've noticed that recently, it's been taking longer and longer to have the return credit or refund issued. Hopefully they can get on the ball with that again, as returns used to be completed quickly.\u000a\u000aI have had two bigger shipping issues and had to have some drawn out exchanges with customer care, but in the end they were able to resolve the problems.\u000a\u000aAs for the customer care reps, I've done the live chat several times and have had pleasant reps assisting me. The wait time for the chat has been pretty good, usually only a couple of minutes. The email exchanges were also quick and helpful. There has only been one rep, out of several that I've had contact with, who was off-putting and somewhat rude on live chat; I ended up just emailing ideeli and another rep helped me out very nicely.\u000a\u000aTo sum up, I would recommend ideeli as it does have a pretty good selection most of the time, good discount/prices, good customer service with returns, and friendly/efficient customer service. It's not perfect, but nothing that terribly detracts from shopping there. It is one of my go-to flash sale sites, and I like it more than most of the other ones.

VWished I would have looked at this site before I purchased from Ideeli.  The worst customer service I have ever experienced....I am 60!  I purchased a jacket which I had confirmation for, but then they removed me from their mailing list so I could not track the purchase.  When they finally responded to my e-mail, approximately 1 week from purchase, they said that they thought it was a fraudulent order and closed my account.  I think this is a way for them to save face, not that they know what that is, to not sent an item they never had in the first place.  Do they outsource all their e-mails and that is why there is a delay in response?DO NOT SHOP ON THIS SITE!!!!

VIdeeli was the first of the online TJ Maxx/Marshalls/etc sites that I ever used.  It has certainly contributed a fair amount to my wardrobe.\u000aShipping:\u000aI generally find the shipping from Ideeli to be, well, ideal. The other sites HauteLook, JackThreads, Fab, etc all seem to have made me wait longer than Ideeli ever has before shipping out my item(s).  They also only make you pay once a day for shipping, which is genius for a site that promotes such impulse purchases as this genre does.\u000aCheckout Process:\u000aAs a website designer that has worked on User Experience, Ideeli blew me away.  There whole checkout process is meticulously geared at getting you to confirm your purchase without really thinking twice. Because of this, be careful with this website if you don't have the purchasing liberty granted by large amounts of disposable income.\u000aVariety:\u000aThey tend towards the higher end items but for pretty deep discounts. They upgraded me to the advanced member section free for 3 months so I could get in on sales before they sold out. That was a bit of a waste. I didn't find that I had any more spectacular options for savings.  This may very well be different if I wasn't a male. The site obviously has far more options for females. Blast! but welcome to the plight of the fashionable, straight male.\u000aOverall, I like Ideeli and check it regularly.  They have solid customer support and I have yet to be 'screwed over' by them. However, I have found myself ordering from Jack Threads more of late; mainly because they carry more casual summer wear options for young men.

VIDEELI HAS UNDERGONE AN INCREDIBLE GROWTH SPURT SINCE I FIRST STARTED BUYING FROM THEM. THERE WAS A BIT OF A 'ROCKY' PERIOD BUT NOW THEY SEEM TO BE CONSISTENT. THEY HAVE THE DEALS, THEY ALSO HAVE SOME OF THE ULTRA LUXE LABLES. THEY ALSO BRING IN A GREAT DEAL OF FRENDH PRODUCT. THEIR REAL CLAIM TO FAME IS 'THE RED' SALE'. THESE BABIES ARE KNOCK DOWN DRAG OUT AFFAIRS AND THE FASTED COMPUTER WILL WIN. THEY ALSO OFFER THE BEST SIZING INFO I'VE FOUND. RATHER THAN USING ONE STANDARD  MODEL FOR EVERYTHING, THEY USE THE INFO FROM THE INDIVIDUAL LABEL. INVALUABLE, AS WE ALL KNOW SIZES ARE ALL OVER THE MAP. ANOTHER GREAT FEATURE IS ALL DAY SHOPPING FOR ONE SHIPPING PRICE ($9.95) THEIR ONLY DRAWBACK THAT I CAN SEE IS HOW LONG SHIPPING TAKES. THEY HAVE ADOPTED A UPS WITH A USPS FINISH WHICH HAS TAKEN ONE OF THE LONGER SHIPPING TIMES AND MADE IT EVEN LONGER!

VJust got my first order in the mail. Everything was there and it came right on time, as they said. Plus I had been tracking the packages constantly due to the poor reviews. It took a month to get here,which I knew would happen at the time of purchase,but that's still a while for a bowl and some utensils. And $9.95 for shipping each time definitely keeps me from buying more.\u000aHowever, I absolutely love my items! They're exactly as the website described, and very unique.\u000aI just ordered a pair of shoes as well,which were wonderfully discounted. It's already being shipped, according to the website, but this tracking number cannot be found. I'll wait a couple days and see if the item ends up at my door. Hopefully.

VI ordered 3 clothing items at once from Ideeli, and they all arrived in one bulk shipment in perfect condition. Tracking of the package was from the exact date projected on the site. It took under a week to arrive, so I was quite impressed.\u000a\u000aI just booked a 2-night stay at a London hotel (complete with daily breakfast and tickets to a nearby attraction) through Ideeli travel. I'm a little nervous about how the whole package will pan out, but I figured with such a seamless first experience, it was worth a shot.

VI have mixed reviews.  At first I bought a few item and I loved them.  Then I had to return some items and I realized what a nightmare it is.  I shipped all the items I was returning in one box.  it was the same way I had received them.  I followed the return procedure as directed.  Then I got an email that only indicated two of the items i sent back were returned. The other two items that were in SAME box were not listed as returned.  I sent an email right away asking what happened to the other items and received what appeared to be an automated response about when i would receive my credit. I could not find a customer service number to contact anyone and am very frustrated right now.  If this isn't resolved I will NEVER shop there again. I have never had this type of problem shopping online.

VI'm writing this minutes after receiving my package.  I have to admit, I was extremely skeptical of my transaction after reading this site last week.  I had a full order placed in the shopping cart and then chose to abandon it after reading numerous bad reviews.  BUT, a few days later I found two items that were must-haves and I was willing to take my own risk.\u000a\u000aI order a sweater that I've always wanted, and boots that I've owned previously but wore them to the brim!  I was even more skeptical because my order would be non-returnable--fearing that something could be wrong with the product since I subjected myself to read multiple bad reviews.\u000a\u000aBUT ALAS!  Items shipped in 6 days... I'm wearing them... no explosions yet.  The boots fit differently than the ones I owned last year (which makes me speculate maybe Ideeli gets the WOMP overstock of brands) but that's okay.  The sweater is warm and stylish.\u000a\u000aAll in all, I've had a great experience.  I enjoy their website, I think graphically it has a better lay-out than Rue La La.  I will definitely shop there again.

VI've never dealt with Ideeli's customer service department so I cannot confirm or deny the issues raised by other reviewers. However, my friend used Ideeli to book for me an amazingly discounted hotel room in Las Vegas for a weekend. Ideeli's discount personally saved me a few hundred dollars, which in my book is pretty good. And this didn't factor into my review, but almost all my female friends are big Ideeli fans.

VI love Ideeli. They have great deals on items I actually want. I haven't had to return anything yet, so I don't know how that works. I'm very careful of what I buy online because it's always a hassle trying to return it, what with the shipping and all. \u000aThey're customer service seems good to me. I ordered a 10 dollar pair of sandals once, and I got an email about a week later informing me that the manufacturer had not delivered those sandals. It wasn't a big deal, but they refunded my money and gave me a $25 credit. I've ordered many items from them, and this has only happened once.\u000aMy only criticism is that they do tend to take a long time to ship. Not a problem usually, but don't try to but a new pair of shoes for an even next week or something. You will almost certainly not receive them in time.

VIn the past month, I've acquired a nearly $10,000 fall/winter wardrobe from ideeli for under grand. that being said, you get what you pay for. while all clothes are brand new with original tags, and often with hangers (:D), it can take over a month to recieve some items. each sale does say when the date items are expected to ship, but 10 days to receive items is absolutely ridiculous. As far as fit, I've only sent two things back so far. My advice is to double check each designer's size chart as then one on ideeli is often incorrect or lacking information.

VI ordered a 400 something D&G dress for the wedding.  I was collecting money for this event for one year.  When the dress arrived I was shocked.  It had tiny hole on the back next to the zipper.  I tried to wear it but you could see flesh through.  I had to run and buy an new dress which cost me another 300 dollars.  I returned the dress expecting money credited  back on my card but they gave only store credit.  I contacted customer service and the lade kept repeating " unfortunately we cannot do anything except give you store credit, the at the end she told me we can only credit if it was iddeli's fault.  But how it's not iddeli's fault they I got damaged dress?   \u000aShe said ok, I will send a request and that was the end of it.  Today I emailed iddeli again practically begging and telling how this caused me so much stress.  I cannot afford purchases again, I don't need store credit. I paid for two dresses already, I have son to feed and cannot spend money that I don't have.  I am waiting and hoping that it will workout.  I will keep updated, but I will not give this up, I feel like I got scammed, they took my money, send me bad product, and want me to make more purchases.  It's like a punishment for something they did wrong.  Please, please iddeli have some decency and return my money back to my credit card, I am exhausted to beg and cry and I don't believe this should happen to anyone.  I will keep you post it on what happens.   UPDATE!!!!  IDDELI CONTACTED ME WITH A GOOD NEWS, THEY APPOLOGIZED ABOUT A DELAY AND THAT THEY WILL CREDIT MY MONEY BACK!!!!  YAY!!!  WILL UPDATE WHEN IT ACTUALY HAPPENS!!!!

VI do love ideeli b/c they have great deals and amazing merchandise, however, it seems like they don't keep up with their inventory as frequently as they should. I bought two pairs of the same shoes in brown and black which was listed as running "true to size." Upon receiving the shoes I was disappointed to find out that they ran about a half size smaller than normal and b/c shipping took so long I only had a day to return it. I consulted with a customer service representative b/c I really loved the shoes and would rather exchange them for the size I needed than return them all together, but was told neither color of shoes was in stock...BUT just a few days later the same shoe in black magically appeared in another sale available in all sizes including the one I needed. By this time my one day to return had already passed and I ended up repurchasing the same shoe in black a second time in the size I needed. Now I have 2 pairs of shoes sitting in my closet collecting dust and have been waiting for the other pair to arrive that I can actually wear. In another situation I placed an order for a shaper I needed for a bridesmaid's dress for a wedding this Saturday the 30th...I placed that order on June 26th, exactly a month ago today, according to my tracking info it's supposed to arrive today...it's still not here. I think ideeli's customer service is fast and convenient, but they need to do a better job with keeping up with their inventory for exchange purposes. Their biggest and most frustrating problem has got to be their horrendous processing and shipping time!!!!!! I am a first row member and I shop on the website almost everyday...there is absolutely no reason a shirt or two can't be processed in a reasonable amount of time and shipped to arrive to me w/in a week or two...I still have items in my orders that are from 2 weeks ago that still have a "in process" status. Ideeli, come on you really need to get with it and do something about this...it's absolutely unacceptable to have your customers wait a month for a product to arrive. I will say honestly I would have given 5 stars had I not been so frustrated with the wait time for my purchases. It is most def worth it to buy from ideeli as you will save and you will be satisfied with the products...just don't expect to received them in a decent amount of time.

I looked at a lot of consumer review sites before ordering just to make sure it wasn't a scam because I am old and afraid of technology. There were some mixed reviews but they were generally favorable so I decided to try it and see what was the what.\u000a\u000aI originally went on looking for a cute dress but ended up getting a really gorgeous turquoise and gold necklace. It was very easy to order, the sites rules and regulations were clearly outlined and the ship dates were clearly listed on the receipt. I was bummed a bit that I had to wait but getting a $200 necklace for $30 was worth it! I even got it a bit sooner than anticiapted! I love the necklave and get compliments on it whenever I wear it. I will definitely use ideeli again for future purchases. :)

VI never had any problem with ideeli when it came to the shipment. It was always on time; however, I purchased a trenchcoat and the quality of the product is not worth the money I paid for. In just a couple of days after I wore it, the buttons fell off one after another. Eventually I had to resew all the buttons. The fabric was thin and of lower quality. I learned to never buy clothes or shoes from internet, it is better to see and try out the product first.

VIdeeli can have pretty amazing customer service! If you email them politely about your problem, they  do try their best to help you get your money back. I accidentally bought the same items (lingerie) twice on two separate account, and wanted to cancel one of the orders. The items were already shipped by that time and according to their online policy, lingerie can't be returned. I wrote to them asking to cancel the order or at least to return the item for store credit. I was confused because I just received a formal message telling me the case is closed. I wrote to them again about the same problem, and got back a long patronizing essay on why if we're allowed to return whatever we want, bags, lingerie, etc, the prices will be a lot higher than we afford... By that time I was pissed and thought I have no chance of getting any money, in the form of actual money or store credit back.\u000a\u000aBut when I looked at my order summary 2 weeks later (first time I checked it since the incident), I saw a return label for my lingerie order. And I was able to return my order for $55 in store credit :). The person who helped me out even used my original store credit toward that purchase, so my credit card was only charged $20 for a $65 order. The only thing I lost was $10 for the shipping and handling fee and having $10 converted from cash to store credit. \u000a\u000aMy problem was especially complicated because I tried canceling after the items are shipped and the items are technically not returnable. Under the two conditions, they really did everything they can to help me out. If you just buy clothing and accessories from ideeli.com, I really can't see how you can encounter any problem. They have super fast and convenient free returns. Every time I returned an order, I receive my store credit w/ 3 days after I shipped it. I think they have a really clean layout and the best deals out of all the sample sale websites too, especially their Red sales. Only thing negative I have to say about them is that their pictures are really misleading about the color of the items. Everything is lighter than it actually is. A light mint dress turn out pure white in their photos, so make sure you always check the description.

VI see so many negative reviews about ideeli.com that I decided to chime in.  I only started buying from them late in 2010, so maybe they fixed a lot of their previous problems? The site clearly states return policy (if there is one, you get free shipping back and store credit, which is fine for me) and sometimes items aren't eligible for return, so it states that and you take a risk.  I've bought a few things with no return policy, but I was sure that I would like them and/or they would fit. There is also a shipping window listed for each purchase and so far they shipped eiher within the window or much much sooner.  I had to make a few returns and never had a problem - try it on, doesn't fit, go to the website, print return label, put back in packaging that the items came in with, drop off at UPS and the next day I get an email saying I have store credit.  To minimize wasting $10 on shipping, I really think twice about buying something as the size chart is not always accurate and some clothing runs large.  So I've only returned something twice and the rest of the things I got were beautiful and cheap - I got $150 BCBG dresses for $30-40 and I went online to other retailers and found those same dresses for sale for over $100.  Just don't buy pants and skirts - they are hard to guess the fit without trying  :)

The only issue I've had is that some items (1 pair of shoes and handbag) were below the level of quality I expected.  However, I have not yet dealt with customer service, so I can't offer an opinion.

VI saw all of the bad reviews AFTER I had placed my order so I was holding my breath. Then I received my top from MM Couture and it was perfect - exactly as described and the right size. The prices are incredible and the presentation of items on the site is very appealing and easy to use. Perusing the pages is kinda fun. It's true, though, that it takes a couple of months but it tells you before you place the order when you can expect the shipment, so I wasn't surprised about that. Also, since everything was as I had ordered, I didn't have to deal with customer service. SO, so far, in summary, I still consider it a good site for shopping. I'll be back though if I place another order and have another good experience or have a bad one.

VI placed my 1st order last week. I was reluctant after because I didn't know much about the site other than the great deals you can get. I ordered 2 pairs of black boots (over the knee and knee high). No one I know have used this site. I decided to search the reviews. After reading some of the experiences on here I was expecting the worst. I was told the order would ship between 1-29 and 2-2. I thought that was reasonable. To my pleasant surprise both pairs arrived today and were brand new.  Today, when I was shopping Macys on-line I found the exact same pair/brand for $70.00  I paid $35.00!!! You can say i'm in shopping bliss! I will definitely be using this site again!

VI like shopping a lot! But, usually I prefer to shop in actual malls and shopping centers, especially when it comes to clothing. Purchasing a dress online was something new for me. I was really excited to discover ideeli web site - the variety of clothing was awesome and prices were great too. However, I was worried to buy anything, so I decided to go to reviews. And I was shocked - most of the people who had an experience with ideeli weren't happy at all! So, I was thinking to myself, should I really do that, but in the same time I loved the dress that was on the web site, and I decide to give it a shot. I did order my dress, and guess what I didn't have any shipping issues, or my dress was a wrong size or color. It is just perfect! I'm glad that I decided to try ideeli, and I liked it! I think I will use this online store for my future purchases!

VI've made a few orders with this website, and have not had any issues. It seems the biggest gripe on here is with shipping; each of my orders have arrived in a timely manner. One took about a couple of weeks, but they didn't charge my card until it shipped. When you place the order in the cart, it tells you the expected ship date people! And even then I still get it before then. I'd hate to see this site go under, because of the opportunity to get such quality designer things at (mostly) reasonable prices. One bag I got for half of the retail price, and before I purchased it I did some research on kitson.com, and they were selling the exact same bag at the same time at full price! As far as I'm concerned, they're legit.

VI've been an ideeli member for months now. I referred a friend, and got a $25 credit when they purchased something. She said it did take a little while to receive her purchase, but it was clearly marked before she selected her items and paid for them, that it would not be shipped for another 2 weeks. She received her items, as ordered with NO PROBLEMS. I used my $25 credit and made a purchase. It clearly stated before I checked out that the item would not ship for another 2 weeks. I got a notice 2 days later that my item had shipped, and recieved it the VERY NEXT DAY. The item was as I ordered it and I received multiple compliments on it.  \u000aI am surprised that so many people are having a bad experience. My same friend also ordered a dress through this site that clearly said no returns, and she had viewed the measurments to make sure she got the right size. Once it came it was clearly too short for her to wear in public and keep her self respect. She called the customer service line, explained that she had checked the measurements, and they allowed her to return the item. I think people reading these comments should keep in mind that normally people don't search for sites to leave comments unless they've had a bad experience. NOT EVERYONE HAS HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE!\u000aA lot of the items you purchase are not returnable and take a while to ship, but it ALWAYS states that before you check out. Keep in mind that you are purchasing designer items at a discounted price, so please understand that they can't just give this stuff away out of the back of a truck.

VI just had my first experience with ideeli.com and I have nothing to complain about. I ordered a dress by Hype. The very next day (8/12) I received an emailing stating that my dress had shipped. I received the dress today (8/16) and it looks perfect! I ordered this dress for my honeymoon so I wasn't really on the "hunt" for that designer item that I've been longing for, like many people do on this site. \u000aAfter I ordered the dress, I found the same one on overstock.com but it was $50 more on overstock! I'm definitely happy with my order and cannot way to look hot in my dress in St Lucia!

VI take care of most of shopping by online and this is one of my favorite sites.  I often compare pricing on same product by different online shopping sites, and ideeli usually offers the same item at the lowest price.  Their shipping turnaround time is not the fastest and inconsistent but I'm not in hurry of getting these items anyway. So I can deal with slower shipping time.  Overall, it's a cool website and they do give courtesy credit when their shipment gets delayed.

Vyes the items hip a little slow, and no they don't stock anything themselves, based on your order they have it shipped form the actual manufacturer / designer. For that reason I can understand that every once in awhile an item I purchased might actually have run out and they need to cancel it ( they should send you a notice though when that happens its ridiculous not to ) ... in regards to customer service they answered my request to return an item within a few hours and even made an exception to take back something which was non-returnable due to the fact it was defective ... I got my prepaid UPS return sticker by email the same day\u000a\u000aSo far the items i ordered were all exactly as pictured / advertised and I don't think they are dishonest at all... you just need to have proper expectations .. this is like a clearance our outlet site .. not an actual store at the mall

VWow. The negative comments are shocking to me. I've been a loyal customer since the beginning. I have never had any problems with items or service. I once did not receive an item. I told them and was immediately credited for it. All my purchases were in excellent condition and of very high quality. Maggie London, Desigual, Casual Couture, Hale Bob, Joyous & Free and Sue Wong are just some labels I like and have bought from here. I'm a savvy shopper and can see if the garment is made well. I also care about fabric and look at the photos very well for indications of craftsmanship. Ideeli sells high/medium/lower quality items, as does any company. I get so many compliments on my wardrobe and 75% of my wardrobe is from ideeli. I loathe shopping in stores so ideeli and amazon are my go-to shops.

VI love this site and would recommend it to anyone based on my experience. \u000aTips to you would be to always google the item you want to see if you truly are getting a good deal, and to ALWAYS check when they say they could ship the item. \u000aThey usually say when they expect to send it away. \u000aAlso pay close attention to the return policy. If you wish to return an item outside of their guidelines it isn't necessarily their fault. But remember, you can buy clothing and try it on basically risk free- My recent deal was a $500 gown for my prom that I got for about $250.

I have ordered about 8 items from them and I have received all of them when expected.  When viewing an item it will tell you when they will ship.  I just ordered a tie and it will take 17 - 21 days for it to ship to me.  But i have waited a month for an item to ship and it came on time.  A lot of their items are returnable.  But i have had wonderful experience with the customer service and all the items have been great quality and came one time.  I recommend them to all my girlfriends.  But I have become addicted to this website, I check it everyday for the new deals. =P

I was surprised with the quick delivery and I can`t complain about shipping , however I noticed that some items are being shipped for a long time. I guess you need to check the shipping dates before you place your order. It might be a problem for some people to wait that long but since you pay less for the product it`s shouldn`t be a big deal.\u000a\u000aIt was my first item purchased through this website and I can honestly say i was satisfied and would recommend it as well as use it again.

VIdeeli offers excellent items at greatly discounted prices.  I have always found my items to be as described on the website, and any problem I have with (typically a garment) is usually due to my personal preference, not with the item itself.  I have returned one garment, and the process was very simple.  A shipping label was provided, and all I had to do was drop it off.  I recommend this site to anyone looking to get high-end products at a reasonable cost.

VI am a big time online shopper. I can tell i've shopped almost all major online clothing companies for last 10 years. Ideeli website is the best clothing store you can imagine. The customer service is also very good. First i thought chatting customer service was a little lame but actually it works better than phone. the reps know what they are doing. email replied within same day. i stop shopping nordstrom or macys or bloomingdales.  I saw a number of bad reviews and i decided to write a real review for ideeli.com. when you order online you have to know very well about your body since you buy items without trying them. you have to be savvy to be a successful online shopper.  I've order items from ideeli at least 3 times per month. I never disappointed with my purchase. yes shipping is sometimes very slow but the price incredibly inexpensive for the brand names! if you need awesome dress for $50, you should be patient.it is worth it. if you are looking for a gorgeous dress and cheap and it should be delivered fast???come on!  then go to neiman marcus and spend $300  for the dress you could get at ideeli for $50.

VI am extremely happy with my first purchase and surprised to see so many irate customers in these reviews. I got a gorgeous L.A.M.B. wallet for $59.99 which I had seen at Nordstroms Rack for $100. Yes, the shipping seemed a little expensive BUT even with the shipping I was still getting something I wanted for cheaper than I could get it anywhere else!\u000a\u000aShipping took about a week with great communication during that time about the processing and shipping and tracking info for my order. When the box arrived, my item was well-packed with some bubble packing and pretty red tissue paper. What a nice touch!\u000a\u000aThe wallet itself was pristine, and I am so glad to share this site with everyone who compliments me on my new wallet.\u000a\u000aPlus, I got a $25 credit since a friend ended up ordering something after I referred her to the site. So far, I have had a great experience with this company and think fashionistas looking for a bargain should give it a try for themselves as I am surprised by the experiences posted here....hopefully for every negative nancy writing a review there are 10 content customers (who are keeping this great website to themselves) because I love ideeli.com and want it to stick around!

VI am actually pretty surprised at the number of negative reviews of the site...I use ideeli quite religiously, and have had some issuesbut nothing that wasn't easily resolved after a quick online chat with one of the customer representatives. Of course I can't speak for anyone else, but the service provided by the website in my experience has been above and beyond. I love that you only pay once for shipping no matter how many times you check out during the day. And that you can edit your purchase upto an hour and half after making it. The time frame for returns could be slightly more lenient, but it shouldn't be a problem, as long as you can make a decision whether you want it within the first few days of having it. I have not had issues with not being refunded my money when I have made returns, and they always send confirmation emails to notify that they've received the shipment. Moreover since its a ups label, you can track the package until it arrives at the ideeli warehouse. As to ideeli running out of stock, this has happened to me once or twice, but I've never been charged for any item they could not ship to me, and have always received a 25 dollar store credit, which I find makes up for the inconvenience. All in all, I recommend ideeli to all my friends--its a great, simple way to find bargain pieces that are unique.

VDon't understand the negative reviews. I think only the angry people which are few and far between make an effort to review the site while the happy people don't bother but I have to give my opinion. First, I looooooooooove Ideeli. My items are normally received the next week as indicated by the shipping. Some items take longer as they have to wait to get them from the manufacturer and the time varies. I think the negative people don't read the shipping guidelines and just think it's Ideeli's fault. All of my items were of great quality and at fabulous prices. I googled the itmes and I save big time. I even see a BCBG dress that I bought from Ideeli being sold on Hautelook a few times at 3 times what I paid for from Ideeli. Their red sales are epic but you have to be fast. It is frustrating when something you want sells out quickly especially during one of their red sales but the prices are very competitive and the quantities are limited in the red sale. So don't let these negative reviews deter you. Shop at Ideeeli!

VI read all the reviews here and I feel for Jason F!  Hang-in-there Jason.  \u000a\u000aI'm a member since 2010. Please know that I had my fair share of issues with ideeli.com.  The way I look at it, this is a young company with tonnes of potential and all the "kinks" we are experiencing right now is  common with new business.  The most important thing is ideeli.com continues to evolve and takes customers' comments and feedbacks seriously.  I suggested an idea and I see changes made. That's what keeps me going back to the site.\u000a\u000aYesterday I received a pair of boots I ordered from ideli.com.  Item arrived with a defect on which the decorative pull on the heels was broken.  I love the boot so much and I sent in an email enquiring for a replacement instead of being on a waitlist for the next sale.  Jessica from the customer service team sent back a very nice reply advising that they don't store item in stock.  I should be mad because I'm expecting a brand new merchandise free of defect which I can enjoy this Thanksgiving right?...but...Jessica and the entire customer service team at ideeli.com shock and humbled me with their unexpected solution.  They refunded my entire purchase price to my credit card (note that they divert from their normal return policy, they are not offering me store credit but refunded my monies!). To top it off they let me keep the the boots.  I know a lot of you may not think that it is a great solution since it is a defective merchandise...but for myself...I did not expect that answer at all.  The fact that they try all within their means to make me a happy customer is enough to make me a loyal customer for life.  \u000a\u000aThe effort counts the rest is only things we have hanging around!  To ideeli.com team keep up the good work!

Then I finally did and so far I'm very happy  - all items but one fit and I was contemplating sending it back but then ended up altering it.I had 3 orders so far, still waiting on the last 2 items, but the rest is perfect! The shipping was exactly according to the guidelines posted for the item - all items were new, correct size and very good quality. Overall, I'm very happy with ideeli.com and will order again!

VI've never experienced an issue with this website. In fact, it's one of my favorite flash-sale sites around! They have the best brands and selections available. Sure, you may not get your order for at least two weeks, but that is the only "complaint" I have ever had. When I did experience an issue, I addressed it on both twitter and through email, and received a response in a reasonable amount of time. I always recommend this website to friends! A plus is they offer a $10 credit every once in a while! They aren't perfect, but for the products and prices they offer, you can't beat it!

VAfter reading all the reviews, I totally expected to be disappointed with my purchases. I expected the shipping to be slow. I expected the products to be irregular/floor samples/incorrect sizes. I took the risk because it was so dirt cheap. I was nervous because I was ordering 3 pairs of shoes, and you are never sure how they will fit! They were also non-refundable because of the extreme discount. My boyfriend told me to just gamble and do it. I'm so glad I took his advice!\u000aFirst, the shoes fit PERFECTLY. \u000aSecond, the shoes were absolutely brand new and probably never have been removed from the packaging/box ever before.\u000aThird, the shipment came in FOUR days.\u000aFourth, the shipment arrived safely at the post office and not left at my apartment door to be stolen.\u000aTHANK YOU SO MUCH IDEELI!

VWow!  I am blown away by the negative reviews on idelli.  I actually just googled idelli reviews because idelli is my favorite on-line shopping EVER!   I used to love eBay.  I do well with Ruelala and Hautelook.com, but idelli is hands down the best for many reasons.  In no particular order, here's why:  Firstly, when you buy higher end clothing, the sizes are TRUE TO SIZE.  Oh my God, I have spent a ton of money on idelli in the past two years and I think only 3-4  things didn't fit (the ones I kept I simply will take to a tailor).  GO to a department store, try on the brand you'd like to buy and trust me, for the higher end clothing, the sizings are extremely consistent.  EXTREMELY. The dresses I have purchased for work - I've never been so well dressed in my life.  And I get compliments daily.  Never got them before like this.  The prices are incredible.  The fact that you can pick out multiple items and it's only $9.95 s&H total is incredible. and the return policy (I only had one dress I spaced out and waited too long), but the 14 days, - hey I am a procrastinator, so for me, some time constraints are a blessing.  And no tax!   The return policy is a piece of cake - piece of cake - but I have UPS at my office so that helps.\u000aThe end of summer sale they had today was fabulous.  And the fact that they offer the same clothes a couple of times - God I love that.  There have been a few items I was too slow on and missed out on.  When they relisted them later (many times heck - a $130 dress for $18!!), I was elated.  \u000a\u000aEnough said.  LOVE IDELLI!!!  Love it - I could never, ever have been this well dressed on my income without you. xxoooxxx

VI bought some sandals called "Penny Loves Kenny" in the "Codi" wooden platform.  I received them in exactly 1 week!  I feel like they're very dependable. I just wanted to add a positive experience to this.  Maybe since they've had bad reviews in the past, they've made their customer service very very good.  I am so satisfied with my purchase, I will definitely come back for more.

VWhat's really going on here? Don't understand... \u000a\u000aI'm shocked to see so many negative reviews here. I have placed at least 20 orders from ideeli so far. Yes, sometimes the item was shipped longer than I expected, sometimes the item arrived not perfectly, however their reps were very very helpful. Every time when I contacted them, they were patient and was willing to help.\u000a\u000a\u000aWell, from my own experiences, if you have a really urgent problem with your order, always try to contact their online reps, they are the most effective ones.\u000a\u000aAnyways, I vote for ideeli, rather than gilt, rue la la, hautelook....

VIdeeli is just about my favorite website.  I have ordered numerous times for personal items, gifts for both men and women, and household items.  I have never been disappointed.  It may take time for the item to arrive but other similar websites are a lot worse.  I will certainly check every day to see what is available.  Keep up the good work.   Margaret Shreehan

VPlease don't listen to all of these badmouther reviewers in this site. They are all complaining about the shipment being really slow and such, when in a matter of fact, when you buy items from ideeli, they exactly tell you when the expected shipment date is. Some of them are 2-3 weeks, some are shorter, but some are just about 1 week or less. And Ideeli stands for their promise. On the expected shipment date, they ship it promptly and for my items, they were delivered to me within 2 days since the shipment date. How come you all say that Ideeli is the worst company and such?! You are getting crazy discount for a very expensive item, I would wait for 3 weeks, since they tell me about it. It's not like they didn't say anything about it before you made your order. You want it fast? Just go to Sax Fifth or Neimann then! Buy at regular price!\u000a\u000aMy experience with Ideeli was awesome. I ordered 2 L.A.M.B watches for gifts and they were perfect! Great quality, authentic like promised, with crazy discounts! Shipment was prompt like mentioned on my order, couldn't be better. 5/5 stars!

VI am sorry a lot of people hav had bad experiences with ideeli...but i must tell you I LOVE this site. Ive made over 15 purchases so far and have had great experiences in all but one of the items. Most of the time the prices are way below the regular price and I can assure you ive never had one item which I did not think had the proper quality. The only bad experience Ive had is getting a dress with the security tag still attached. Ideeli told me to return it and that they would send it back again and pay for shipping, I tought it too much of a hassle and decided on removing it with my Dremel tool (not recommended unless you really know how to work this tool). After this the dress was lovely and I got tons of compliments on it. Ive allways been happy about my ideeli purchases.\u000a\u000aOther two sites I can highly recomend are gilt and hautelook.\u000a\u000aRegards\u000amabel

VI always had a good experience with, them specially customer service. They always answer within a couple of minutes online while the sale is going on. They even called to my home to clarify some doubts I had. I have nothing bad to say of this company. I agree that shipping takes longer than expected that is why I can't buy gifts for other people's (e.g.birthdays)  but, by any means I consider that as deceiving.

VThe site clearly states the ship dates and return policy for each sale. I purchase 1-3 items a month and have never had a problem with authenticity or item quality. In fact one item I purchased did not sell out and was listed a week later for $20 less than I paid, ideeli credited my account the $20 immediately.

VShopping on Ideeli.com was a great experience.  I brought a BCBG Maxazria dress (which is $348 in the store) for $70 on this website.  They shipped the dress before they even said they would and sent me an email to let me know that it was coming.  The dress is perfect and I'm thrilled! I also contacted the customer service via email and they responded in about 1 or 2 hours with an answer to my question.

VI really like ideeli.com.  I look at the sales every day.  I've had to return items before because they were the wrong size.  Not because ideeli sent the wrong size, but because they just didn't fit me. I have never had trouble returning an item. I buy mainly dresses and a few sweaters. I was really surprised to see the poor reviews. I think the site spells out very explicitly how the sales, shipping, and returns work.  I will continue to use ideeli!

VI signed up for ideeli without reading the reviews.  Then I saw all of these terrible things about how people hadn't gotten the right product, it had taken forever, yadda yadda yadda.  \u000a\u000aBut...I was hooked by the prices so I tried it anyway.  I've bought about 8 things from Ideeli.com on 4 separate occaisions.  Each time, they have not only gotten my order correct, but it has also come around 4-5 days after I purchased it, which is waaaaaaay before it said it was going to arrive online.  I've now decided to only shop at ideeli instead of gilt and hautelook, as I have also ordered items from those sites, and have yet to get them.\u000a\u000aThanks ideeli.  :)

VI ordered a dress, and it was shipped very quickly (ahead of schedule).  The only problem was that the color was way off than what was pictured on the website. Normally if the color was a little off, it wouldn't bother me, but this was a much darker green instead of a softer, jade green, and green can go horribly wrong!\u000a\u000aIt was marked as not returnable, as is most of their merchandise.  However, I immediately contacted them within a couple hours of it being delivered to me, and the Live Chat member was nice enough to accommodate me and e-mailed me a prepaid return label and I will get a store credit.  Sure, it would have been much better to be able to get a refund, but I'll take the credit.  \u000a\u000aThis was my first order, and although it didn't work out, I am willing to give them another shot.  My experience with their service wasn't bad.  There are many great deals to be found on their site.  It's a shame this dress didn't work out, b/c it really is a great dress, but the color is just off.

VI really enjoy shopping on ideeli. Yes there are shipping delays and sometimes an item is out of stock - but their prices are AMAZING - truly the best online. I do agree with the other reviewers but you have to realize that when you get a deal that good that it is going to come with a few strings ie delays and the chance that they had say 50 bags yet 70 people clicked buy it now and at the same time and there systems get overloaded and they can run out of stock. Personally I think some buyers expectations are too high its a bargain website take it for what it is and have fun with it. If your in desperate need of an item - don't use the - they are obviously dropshippers and sometimes lines get crossed - but if your looking for bargains go for it.

VI was a little apprehensive after reading people's comments on this site, but I saw a dress I loved and went ahead and gave it a shot- and I'm glad I did! It came less than a week after ordering and was exactly what I wanted. The only thing I can't say I'm a fan of is the shipping charge. At nearly $10, it's kind of pricy if you're just ordering one item, as i did.

VI love it! Here's why - it has some really genuine designer stuff, that i won't even look at otherwise, at insanely low prices - thats the bottom line.\u000a\u000aBut of-course, since nothing comes free, you have to pay for this in other ways\u000a- it charges $10 for shipping, which, in my view, is insane\u000a- it takes ages to reach you. But, the shipping dates are specified next to the product in your cart. And, till date, i have almost always received items before the estimated dates. There was a delay once. But i didn't mind it because ideeli gave me a $10 credit for that.\u000a- Some of the products cannot be returned - again, this is clearly noted next to the product description\u000a- You have only 7 days (from shipping date) to return the item - so you never buy something unless you are sure you'll keep it\u000a-Unless you decide to pay for the membership, lost of cool stuff gets sold out before you get to it\u000a- Your cart is not saved for more than 10 min. Hence, if you thought you could save the cart, fill it up, and then order (and save some shipping costs), it does not work\u000a\u000aDespite all this, i have been able to get some really good stuff from there so i am going to go back. Also, in the last year, i have shopped there atleast once a month if not more. With experience, i have gotton better at using the site.

Vbought a dress. perfect transaction. came in less than one week. exactly as described. Site requires a mature person who has read the terms- no refunds, only credits given, range of delivery times, due to nature of site-fantastic deals on high end merchandise and designer clothing not normally available to average consumer- you have to have some flexibility. know what you want, know your body type, do not try to return worn clothing. keep all tags and packaging. Items are leftovers from shows  etc. so sometimes they cannot get their hands on merchandise due to competing interests from other sites. you are going to have some disappointments due to competition for a limited resource. I know I will win some and lose some. Something else will come along if you miss out on a bargain and what bargains. LOVE THIS SITE. with two girls and myself, a great way to be on the runway at home for a fraction of the cost.

VI was terrified after I made my first purchase from Ideeli and then read this site. I was like what in the world did I get myself into. \u000aWell: \u000a(1) It states on their website next to every purchase made that the item will not schedule to ship for approximately 3-4 weeks after purchase. \u000a(2) It states you will be charged upon receipt of the order placement and shipment is scheduled to depart their warehouse.\u000a(3) Shipping states to allow another 7-10 business days\u000a\u000aThey far exceeded those expectations. I received my order 7 business days after ordering it! The item was perfect; in its original packaging. \u000a\u000aI am not stating this site is perfect. I am sure it has its fair share of issues. However, I do think that people do not read what the site says and then get angry because they don't receive their product for 2 months (which according to their site is all they promise, no more no less).
