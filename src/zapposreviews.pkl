VVery good selection, but overpriced compared to other online shoe stores.  I think they build the cost of "free shipping" and "free returns" into the original cost of the product to make people think they are getting a deal, but really they aren't.  I used to shop there a lot, but lately I find better prices through Amazon or the designer's website directly.

VI am a VIP member so I get free overnight shipping and free returns. I love their service and selection. I have to admit that their sales may not be as good as other sites so I will only buy from here if I know that I can't get it cheaper elsewhere. For example, Uggs are never on sale so I will def order from Zappos and get them the next day.\u000a\u000aI am a bit concerned now because I got an email last week that their system got hacked.

VI ordered some boots from this site. They were very affordable. The only issue was that they sent me the wrong boots. They were by the same company, the same material and color, but they were the wrong style. I didn't realize this until I actually wore them out. \u000a\u000aIn the end, it turned out that I really liked them anyways. I didn't want to risk sending them back for the other boots, and then find that the boots they sent me by mistake I liked better. Not that I could send them back now, since I already wore them. \u000a\u000aI am still a happy customer, because it turned out that I really liked the boots they sent me, even if it was a mistake.

VI ordered a pair of shoes a few months ago and upon receiving them, I thought they might be too big, but I was afraid that the next size down would be too small. I wore them around the house for awihle before putting them in my closet and forgetting about them. I found them recently and decided to return them and try the smaller size. Thanks to Zappos' fantastic 365 day return policy, I was able to return them without a problem, even though it had been several months. When I called customer service about the return, they were extremely helpful and nice...the epitome of how customer service should be. They paid the return postage for me to ship the bigger size back and covered the postage on the new ones. Even though I had bought the original shoes on sale and they were not any longer, they didn't charge me any more to send me the other pair. To top things off, I got my new pair in 2 days! I could not be more happy with the service and would recommend this company to anyone.

VJudging by all the great reviews on this site it seems that my review is not needed but here it is anyway. Zappos has a huge selection of quality brand items at great prices. Usually I can find it cheaper on Zappos than any of the retail stores. First off, the shipping is fantastic. It comes basically comes overnight and the best part is that it's free. Sometimes items can take maybe up to two or three days but I'm used to waiting the standard 7-14 so no complaint here. The have an excellent return policy, probably the best I've ever seen and you can alway's find your size which can sometime be daunting for me because I'm very tall and slender and that makes shopping for pants a nightmare. Zappos has totally eliminated that problem. The only down side is when an item goes out of stock it takes quite sometime for them to restock it so when this happens chances are you should just check somewhere else other wise you will be waiting for it for a long time. Zappos is definitely one of the best sites I have ever had the honor of dealing with.

VZappos is THE best site from which to order shoes and clothes. There is free shipping both ways but I've only ever had to return one item and it wasn't Zappo's fault but the shoe manufacturer's misrepresentation of their sizes which ran smaller than they stated. Zappos couldn't have been more helpful. It was as simple as clicking a box to return the shoes and they immediately responded, asking my preferences, I chose having my return shipping label emailed to me for printing at my convenience. It arrived immediately.   My credit card was reimbursed promptly with no problems. \u000aZappos has put customer service at the top of their list in importance and it shows. A bonus: Not only are their representatives efficient and helpful on the phone, they're funny too! I would recommend Zappos.com to anyone anywhere any time.  Order by 1pm and you'll have it the next day!  It doesn't get any better than that!

VZappos.com has made our lives so much easier. I have foot problems and it often takes a very long time for me to find shoes which fit properly. Now, instead of dragging around from store to store, I can buy a bunch of shoes at Zappos and see what works for me. Often I wind up returning quite a lot of shoes, but there are ones that work, and I keep them. \u000a\u000aAdd to that a teenager who loves shoes but hates to shop. She also has really small feet and it can be hard to find her size in stores. That is another way that Zappos shines, IMO. And when both kids needed shoes for proms or special occasions, Zappos again really fit the bill. I got the shoes AND the little clutch purse there. Slam dunk! \u000a\u000aNone of this would be possible without their free shipping/free returns policy. And it's a 365-day return policy, too. I don't know how they can afford to do that, but they do honor it. \u000a\u000aI still go down to my local high-quality shoe store from time to time, but if I'm searching for a particular thing and don't have the time or energy for that sort of physical shopping, Zappos really helps.

VIn addition to all the other great reviews here about Zappo's service, professionalism, returns, refunds, etc.,  I want to mention that I've experienced that they do honor their price reduction policy, if they reduce the price of an item on their site within their specified policy.  You just have to do the work of going back online and looking up your items to see if the price went down.   It is a no hassle deal, just go online or call to let them know, and they auto-refund the price difference.\u000a\u000aI must add how wonderful Zappos was in a certain situation I got myself into with Paypal and a warning to you all about Paypal to share with your friends, as well.   \u000a\u000aI had just validated my bank account with Paypal, because that gives you better buying power on eBay.  When I next paid for an extremely large order with Zappo for over $2,000, I paid through Paypal like I normally did, only I didn't realize that once you validate your bank account, the greedy Paypal scumbags make your bank account the DEFAULT payment option and you cannot change your default account and make it "stick"; you can only change your mode of payment during the last stage of each and every purchase transaction thereafter, unless you remove the validation.\u000a\u000a(I call Paypal  greedy scumbags because they have the market on online payment yet choose a default option that no customer would want  and one that you may miss if in a hurry and be in a world of hurt as a result... - who the heck would intentionally choose to pay cash out of your bank account instead of all the benefits and protections that your credit card would afford you?)\u000a\u000aI nearly died a week later, when I noticed Paypal took that money out of my bank account and all my auto-payments from my checking were about to bounce.  I quickly went through what I needed to return to Zappo's, as I knew most of the shoes would not fit my difficult to fit feet and called Zappos Customer Service to notify them of the return, hoping they didn't have a long wait with their refund process, and expecting them to tell me a week or so after receipt of my goods.\u000a\u000a==========You won't believe this!   Before the goods even left my house, right while I was on the phone, Zappos refunded the amount through Paypal, and the money was redeposited two days later from Paypal back into my account.  I'd never experienced such a wonderful, amazing, caring and considerate company as Zappos before in my life!    \u000a\u000aP.S.  Now, I must mention that I'd purchased several hundred dollars from Zappos  in the past and was a VIP customer, but still...!!.  I guess they just figured that if they didn't receive the return, they certainly had the legal right to charge me again.  Yet, I've never known a company to refund, without even a postal/ups confirmation #, only their own company's computer return confirmation # was used.\u000a\u000aZappo's, you're the greatest!

I often order 3 or 4 pairs of sneakers and try them on, decide which ones to keep and return the others. If I can buy something on Zappos, I will, even if I can find it a little cheaper on other sites because with shipping costs, Zappos almost always ends up being the cheapest option.

They are helpful with orders, ship quickly (usually overnight!), are fantastic with returns and credit my Visa quickly.  The quality is always fantastic as is the communication! I decided I needed trailrunners as backup shoes to my hiking boots a few days before I was to leave for Peru to backpack 26 miles to Machu Picchu.  Zappos.com was fantastic about this, shipped me the shoes overnight, and the customer service person then sent me a note with well wishes for a fantastic hike to Machu Picchu!  I wish all websites were like Zappos.com!  I'd recommend this website to everyone!

VI purchased a pair of Heely's for my son's 6th birthday, needless to say they were too small when he tried them on. It was a Saturday night and he was very upset but I called customer service anyway. I told them the shoes were too small and he was really upset that he couldn't wear them yet. The gentlemen I spoke with was very understanding and over nighted me a larger size and we had them Tuesday afternoon. To my son's surprise, they arrived much earlier than I had expected. I would buy from them again without any question!

VThis is unbelievable!  Zappos.com is terrific.  An almost Wal-Mart-like return policy.  Their images accurately portrayed the TEVA's I bought.  My mother bought these as a gift for me and they shipped them to my address even though it was different than thee credit card.  That is something many companies do not do.    I did not have a high enough limit on my card, so my father bought me an HP laptop and it didn't show up for 2 weeks, we called and inquired, apparently the credit card did not match the shipping address, they didn't call.  Tried again with them.  Same thing.  Finally on the 3rd try got it.  Then went through the same thing with a industrial printer with them, SAME thing.  Zappos on the otherhad was flawless.  My mother bought me this gift on a Sat. I got them either Monday or Tuesday!  Well packaged, flawless and she also got an email confirmation.  Absolutely at the top of the internet retail craft.  Probably the best or one of the best for footwear.  They should be used as a case study for internet retailers.

VLOVE, LOVE, LOVE this site! How I wish every shopping website's like Zappos! NO HASSLE WHATSOEVER! I found out about Zappos more than 5 years ago. I've been a Zappos shopaholic eversince. I have at least 5 purchases this year from shoes to watch to skin care and its not even close to the end of year yet. I wasn't able to use the FREE returns but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be a problem if ever I need to. Yes! They're  also selling skin care and beauty products, and beddings, and watches, and fashion jewelries, and so on! I wish Zappos would also sell pet products for my 4-legged "son" and "daughter", and furnitures for my home. I like the videos of the products modeled by actual, normal people like you and me not by skinny models. I can better visualize how the product would look on me! Zappos, you did a good job, keep it up! Zappos is not a 4-star website, it's a 5-star site!

VIf you have wide feet, narrow feet, long feet, short feet, or feet in general, Zappos has exactly what you need. They have the best selection of any online shoe store I have ever visited and their customer service is unbeatable. I very rarely find identical shoes on a different website for a slightly lower price, but the free shipping makes up for that potentially slight issue. When you order from Zappos, you get your shoes almost immediately. If you have to return your shoes, you get your refund or credit almost immediately. And with a whole year to decide whether or not you want to keep your purchase, it's impossible to get stuck with something you don't want because you got too busy to return it in time. \u000a\u000aA+ all the way!

I also love their return policy.  You have one year to return your purchase as long as it is returned in "new" condition in original shoe box.  They will give you refund or store credit - your choice. I've been shopping with them for 4 years and have NEVER had any problems.  Excellent customer service!! One time I didn't receive my purchase within 5 days.  Called to inquire and they sent another pair of the same shoes right away. No questions asked!!
