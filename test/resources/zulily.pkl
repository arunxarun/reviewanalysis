VI ordered an infant dress from Zulily from the manufacturer "Truffles Ruffles".  The order arrived close to the time promised (approximately 3 weeks after placing order) BUT the merchandise was junk!  The dress and headband appeared to have been recently made, never steamed, pressed or even had the stray sewing threads removed.  In other words, no finishing work had been done.  The photos and description of the items were vastly different than the items received.  I could have purchased a thrift store dress and had a better result.  NEVER AGAIN will I trust a merchandiser on Zulily.

VI wish I had read these reviews first. Ordered boots and they looked very different from the photo. Material was incredibly cheap, didn't fit, and had defects. Clearly mass produced crap from China...I spent $17 and honestly would not have taken them even if they were free. With shipping it came to about $25. Thoroughly disappointed and feel really deceived by the photos they posted. Will never shop here again.

VI should have known better after the shoes I ordered from then that you couldn't even put on because the strap over the shoe had no give. Today I received a ring I ordered in a size 9 for my daughter and although it has a tag that says size 9, it doesn't even go on my size 8 finger.\u000a\u000aI ordered a beautiful futurre Christmas dress for my great-granddaughter and know that will fit as it will be a few years for her to grow into it.

VI placed an order on Dec 19 for two utility baskets - two different sizes and two different colors.  When I received them on Dec 30, they were wrong - they are both the same color.  I contacted Zulily on Dec 31 to report the issue.  They said they need to contact their vendor to see if they have the correct stock available to send to me, or else they will refund me.  I STILL HAVE NO ANSWER!  I've sent 3 or so follow up emails checking on the status, to be told again and again that they are STILL waiting to hear back from the vendor.  They said due to the holidays, blah, blah, blah.  The holidays are over! AVOID ZULILIY!  Pain in the butt.  Jean was very helpful when I made the initial call - she asked me to provide a photo, which I did within' 5 minutes.  Now, I'm outta sight, outta mind apparently.

VI am soooo dissapointed!  I ordered two items on Jan 1, 2014.  One was a pair of gray tights/yoga pants which aren't here yet.  The other was a really pretty hanging vase. Rustic metal with a chain holding a glass vase.  I got it today....CRACKED AND BROKEN WITH A PIECE THAT JUST FELL OUT!!  They didn't even have enough bubble wrap around it to keep it from getting broken!!  These orders can sometimes go through a lot of rough handling.....we all know this......so why would it not be wrapped heavily.  I'll NEVER order from them again and sending it back?  I shouldn't have to waste my time. Even if they paid for me to ship it back, it is a waste of my time....and the first time ordering from them too.....LESSONS LEARNED.  (sad right now) :(

Then I got another email, stating I needed to confirm my online purchase again as they had not deducted the funds from my account.\u000aBottom line-  ordering the site's products was not user friendly and not customer service oriented.

VZulily is a great website if you enjoy waiting a month to be sorely disappointed in your purchase. I've purchased a couple tops and a pair of boots and nothing has been  as described. It has all been cheaply made and very poor quality. I had blown up the pictures and scrutinized the items and size charts before ordering, and everything has been too small. The description of the boots had measurements. I used a measuring tape to measure my feet and calves to make sure they would fit. They were too small because the measurements on the site were wrong. Even though Zulily made the mistake and misrepresented their product, they still won't give me a refund. I've filed a complaint with the BBB about this company.

VI ordered an infinity scarf and blouse in November before Thanksgiving, I got it just before Christmas. That aside, when I got the products, they smelled like smoke or something else not fresh. I noticed the quality of the scarf was terrible but I figured I could still make it work. There were no washing instructions only a tag that said 100% acrylic. I put it in a mesh bag and washed in cold water, hung to dry. It looks horrible and is unraveling. I knew I wouldn't buy again from his site when I called to check on my items and was told they don't have the items they order them from a third party then they are shipped to them and then to customer, some mess like that. Anyway, looks like I ordered a scarf from someone's basement. Never again.

VZulily started out as a wonderful place to find a reasonable deal on some unique items.  Now it is nothing but a sweat shop churning out ill made and cheap clothes.  Unless I'm buying a brand that I absolutely know will be high quality such as Keen or Columbia, I have sworn them off.  In one instance I thought I was buying GUESS brand clothing for my little girl and it ended up being a knock off.  There have been at least two times that I was charged for an item and it did not arrive.

On more than one occassion, I\u2019ve ordered product that has been misrepresented, in poor condition (missing parts/size wrong) - or not the item pictured.  Their customer service has grown increasingly apathetic, and does not stand behind the products they represent.

VI ordered on December 6 2013 for Christmas.  My order was $182 and guaranteed to arrive by Christmas.  I checked my checking account the following day and the money had been taken out of my account (VISA on hold). On December 17 I receive a notification that I needed to contact them within 48 hours or my order would be cancelled as they were unable to charge my card.  Apparently they "tap" your checking account when you order to make sure you have the money--- then cancel the charge??? then re-charge it when they receive it from the manufacturer, inspect it, and get ready to ship it.  Apparently they also charge for the items based on the manufacturer\u2026 so my account was $5 short when they went to charge the final $21 of the $182 -- I get it straightened out and am told I would receive it by the 12/23.  Only received 3 of the 5 items with the two most expensive items over $100 (they charged me for the second time already-not the item I was $5 short) it is now the 26th of December and still waiting.  NEVER ORDERING FROM THEM AGAIN!!

VI placed an order on 12/11/13 for four Joybay Swing Car Ride-On's "Guaranteed Christmas Delivery". I received three of the four on 12/19/13.  I contacted Zulily on 12/22/13 to get a status on the fourth.  The rep let me know that the item had a tracking number, but no information.  He assured me that he would place a new order and again "Guaranteed Christmas Delivery"....super! Well on 12/23/13 I contacted them again to confirm the order had been placed and that I would receive by 12/24/13.  The rep said the order had not been placed and she'd be upfront with me, "You missed the 10am cut-off for next day delivery so your item will not arrive until after Christmas"...wonderful!  These are "Santa Gifts" for four of my children.  How do I give to three and leave one out!?  Had to go out and get another Santa gift.  I contacted Zulily again today and demanded a refund!  The rep said I was refunded on 12/23/13 for the amount, but not shipping and handling, I have yet to see it hit my bank account so we'll see.  I also let him know that I have not yet received the car and wanted to see if I could get a status.  Guess what, a tracking number with no info.  How hard is it!?  I told him I no longer want the car.  How would I explain a gift dropped off by Santa after Christmas.  I will have to reject the package on delivery...this is assuming it arrives.  Oh and I sent a "feedback" email on 12/23/13 and they have yet to respond.  This was my first and last shopping experience with Zulily! Goes to show you....Don't believe everything you find on Facebook.

VI have always had pretty good experiences with this website. I mean shipping is always terrible but for the price I am able to purchase some things it's worth the wait.  So this holiday season they had Lego clothes on sale which I purchased for my nephew because he LOVES Legos. The only reason I ordered them is because it was guaranteed Christmas delivery if it wasn't I would have never purchased items cause I know their shipping is so slow. On December 23rd I checked the tracking and it said my stuff was in Illinois and to be delivered on December 28th. I wrote them 3 emails about this to which I got one response to please see their shipping policies. I don't care what their shipping policies are don't guarantee something if their is a possibility it can't be done! Needless to say it's Christmas Day and I have no gift for my nephew. I'm not only disappointed in the shipping but also in the lack if customer service. It was literally just swept under the rug. I have spent a lot of money on that site and can honestly say I will never buy anything from them again. I would rather pay more somewhere else than give my money to a company that could obviously give a $#*! about customer service and customer satisfaction.

I don't feel like going into the minor things (hard to avoid getting on daily email list for one), but the big one appears to be how long it's likely to get an order (if ever). I went through the purchase process without getting any info on shipping, and foolishly assumed that since Christmas is coming they'd make every effort to get it to me by then.  It was not until after the purchase that I got an email explaining how zulily "works".  I ordered something on 12/18 with no indication of it not being in stock; now I find that estimated shipping date is Jan 5, which means it might arrive by the 10th.

VWhy cant' we give negative or 0 stars? I ordered a Christmas present for my 7 year old nephew and my package was guaranteed to arrive before Christmas.  I was told via a generated e-mail that my package shipped on Wed 12/11.  When I didn't see in change in the tracking after a couple of days, I called and they said that I had to wait 5 days just to be safe.  I waited.  I called back and was jerked around about where my package was.  No one ever called me back when they said they would or returned e-mails as promised.  I finally called again this morning, only to be told that they had no idea where my package was, that they were declaring lost and I would receive my refund in 7-10 days.  They were never planning on telling me that my Christmas gift wasn't coming!!  They lied too.  Everyone I spoke with gave me a different story.  Now I am scrambling to find a last minute gift.  What a bunch of Grinches and jerks!!

VI am so disappointed with this company. I place 5 different orders around the 23rd of November. I have only received 4 of the 10 items so far. I got an email yesterday stating one of my orders had been canceled. Nothing like last minute, eh? I love that you can't return/exchange/refund ANYTHING, but zulily can charge you for an item and then cancel the order a month later. Shipping is a frigging joke. $7.95 per order and you wait, at a MINIMUM, a month for it to be shipped. The commercials you see on TV are falsely advertising that you can't find these deals anywhere else. I decided to test that statement. They were offering Zaggora work out gear a few weeks back so I went to to Zaggora's website directly and they were running the EXACT same sale on their website...same prices as zulily. They had more options and you were able to return and exchange. What a joke zulily is! Do yourself a favor...use zulily as a reference point and then find those items (for the same price, better shipping price/time and be able to return if needed) on a different, more reliable site.

He was amazing at the Job got great numbers and received several rewards for his work. on the 28th day of Employment, they FIRED him because of the background check in which he was told was ok.

I have waited a month for the item and yesterday I received an email telling me they no longer have the item that was reserved for me.  For my inconvenience, they offered me a store credit of $10.

VI placed an order November 23, 2013, they broke my stuff into 4 separate packages even though they are from only two different brands.  I got my first e-mail stating that some of my items had been shipped on December 13, but with an estimated delivery date of 5-10 business days.  Today (Dec.16) I got the last e-mail out of the four stating that my package had been shipped and again that means I won't be getting that stuff until the end of the month!!!!!  I'm very disappointed, never imagined it would take about a MONTH for me to get my stuff.  I get diapers I order online in TWO days and whenever I buy clothing I wait ONE WEEK tops to get my stuff.  Not only that, most of their stuff cannot be returned, but even if it was can you just imagine how long that would take!  Just a waste of time..... They do have neat and super cute stuff for little girls but I'm sure they can be found in other websites, more efficient ones.

That is ridiculous in this day and times when products are delivered in two days time. I stopped ordering a week ago when I realized they DRAG on shipments. I needed to ship these gifts to different people and now I'm screwed!! What's the point?

VAs with many other reviewers, the item I received was not the item I ordered. It was a different manufacturer, a different fit, and a different design. And it looked incredibly cheap. It was similar to the one on their website but not what I ordered. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones, because they agreed to take the item back. I don't really understand how a company like this can stay in business. It's my bad for not researching them first, but given how many good discount/online retailers there are (Sierra Trading Post being my favorite), it's hard to see how they manage to turn a profit. Unless it's mostly first-time customers who get burned and never come back. Lesson learned.

VI bought from Zulily off and on over the last two years, probably spending a few thousand over the years.  They used to have great stuff at a decent discount, as well as high quality stuff, in the beginning.  But starting last year/xmas time, I noticed that my purchases were hit or miss... sometimes I would love the item that I buy and other times I would just junk it.  I started ordering from Zulily again in October/November of 2013 for xmas, and the stuff I'm getting is PURE JUNK.  I noticed that they also INFLATE the original price, making one think you're getting more of a deal (when in fact they are just pure lying). Example, this week they have costco memberships for $55 and $110.  How is that different from buying from Costco directly?  It isn't.  However, they listed the "original price" as $160 and $220, respectively, making one think that they actually saved money.  Also, I bought $400 in toys (Battat) just to find out that I could have gotten it for the same price OR LESS on Amazon. I have some credits on Zulily, and once I use it I will never order from them again.  Rip off and a junk store now.... too bad.  I used to connote Zulily with high quality, which is what it used to be in the beginning.  Sad that they are now all about money, selling junk and lying about the original prices.

VI ordered a Christmas gift for my nephew on Zulily.com.  Once it finally arrived, they mysteriously billed my credit card multiple times (in odd amounts) AND charged me for shipping (which is supposedly free when you spend over $20).  When I called to find out what the heck was going on, they explained "We don't bill your credit card until the items ship out.  The extra charges you are seeing are for "pre-authorizations.  These extra charges will disappear after 72 hours".  Ok- we will see.  Maybe I'm missing something here, but I don't understand why they would be charging odd "pre-auth" amounts to my Visa AFTER I have already paid for the items and AFTER the items were delivered?  Will NOT be using them again.

VThought I was in shoppers heaven when I first joined and I bought nearly every day spending upwards of $7,000 in the first 4 months (have cancer, don't shop at malls, buy gifts for loved ones because who knows next year I may not be able to and no, I'm not wealthy but am spending their inheritance).  I found slow delivery times mildly annoying but I adjusted to it.  \u000a\u000aCustomer service is terrible - the reps have NO power to do anything but they are trained to talk someone down from screaming frustration.  The largest complaint I have is NO RETURNS for faulty merchandise or slipshod advertising.   In the past approx 45 days I have donated $400 in Zulily merchandise to a local charity for differences in manufacturers sizing, low quality, transparent fabrics made of stretchy synthetics, misshapen shipping accidents, and many other flaws.  \u000a\u000aI studied their presentation of items/listings on their site closely before buying.  Photography is often poor and inadequate to make an informed decision about buying.  You can't see more than one view and often even with zoom the photos do not show details.  SURPRISE!  I took many chances, ordered and was surprised to find colors off, cheap fabrics, unprofessional construction, low quality.  Short and inadequate descriptions that are often copied over to describe other similar but not exact items.  Descriptions offer inane information that wastes limited listing space such as "will delight your little princess"; "has many uses", etc.  What we need is full disclosure.  I know that is asking a lot for their turnover of merchandise often lasting 2-3 days but when a business is asking the public to support it billion dollar growth they can't afford these kinds of inferior marketing, advertising and customer service errors. \u000a\u000aTerrible packing/shipping!  I received clothing ($50 girl's dress) crumpled up in a ball of wrinkles among many other examples.  I have heard from one of their employees that they are overworked and underpaid and packing centers have no A/C in summer or insufficient heat in winter; 8 bathrooms for 7,000 employees often without TP.  That's just the beginning of the problems they have in rapid growth.  No wonder they crumple things up.  \u000a\u000aQuality is so important when you gift someone... is your dollar going for the best you can buy?  I've taken to not giving in to their scary"buy it now, last one" type messages.  Instead, I go to similar sites and do comparisons for price, finding for instance reviews on Amazon to be a great resource of information.   I also Google the manufacturer's site to gain more in-depth information about the product.\u000a\u000aAnoter observation is current style.  Come on, everything from 1970's maxi dresses to 1990's mini-mini dresses?  Fashion has trends and does not include everything mankind ever found trendy, it changes from season to season.  Many times the items they offer are waa-ay out of style, the kind of thing you see on Macy's 70% off rack for months on end or in a mall sidewalk sale.  It takes a LOT of time to peruse their site on a daily basis if you don't want to miss out on a item.  Can't tell you how that suckered me into wasting hours of time.  That's on me, though.  \u000a\u000aThey offer customers a "My Closet" feature that allows you to see everything you have purchased and the funny thing is they tell you how much you have saved by buying from them.  This is based upon inflated Manufacture's Suggested Retail Prices (and I have found the MSRP on other sites for exact items to be lower than they quote), thus the "savings" are inflated and this is supposed to fool us how?  It is a questionable marketing practice at best and a lie at worst.\u000a\u000aBottom line is Zulily just launched worldwide sites catering to each country BEFORE they solved the obvious problems of their U.S. site.  We'll see how that goes.  As long as they are making money and customer's think they are getting a quality bargain they will rake in the bucks and their stock will soar but when customers (finally)  figure out the drawbacks of shopping with them will it be too late for them to recover their share of the market?  Or are they going to be satisfied with a flash-in-the-pan success?

VI have been a loyal zulily customer from the beginning but the quality of the goods and the customer service have gone down as zulily grew. The odds are no longer in the customer's favor. You have to understand the company model. They work with companies to sell odd lots etc. They are not a warehouse. They advertise the stuff, take orders, and then the items are sent to customers. And now it takes a really, really long time to get your items. Sometimes a month. Better to buy local. And sometimes when the goods get to the customer, they are of poor quality. Zulily doesn't care, there will always be another customer. Read the reviews here and on their FB page and beware.

VI read up on the site before I made a purchase and understood it would take some time for my order to arrive and that they do not accept returns. When my order got to me after a few weeks, one of the headphones I purchased  was damaged. I contacted them and got a refund for the headphones plus a $10 credit to cover the shipping I had paid for. I was happy with that and ordered a pair a boots from them the next week. When I went to pay for the boots I had a $410 credit instead of $10. I contacted customer service again and they gave me the boots for free because I let them know about the $400 error. When I got the boots a few weeks later I open them up to find that they smelled so badly of diesel fuel that I had to leave them outside. They are the cheapest boots I have ever seen. Poorly made and thin material. I would have complained but they were free. After 3 weeks of leaving them outside they still smell. Can't even give them to Goodwill, I'm throwing them away!

VIf you are unhappy about the time it takes to receive an order, you need to understand how the site works. They don't have the merchandise on hand that they offer. They offer it for a certain amount of time and then order it from the company/distributor/importer. That's also why there are no returns.\u000a\u000aThat said, I don't recommend ordering from this site. Have you ever had socks not fit??  I mean a standard pair of women's socks that won't go over an average size foot? They were clearly a factory mistake or "second" and I have no recourse. I have had a couple of other similar experiences when I thought I'd give them another chance...both were disappointing. And why take that chance when there are so many other discounted online shopping sources that 100% stand by their merchandise? Anyway, and online shopping experience that requires you to log in with email and a password is just ridiculous.

The other half was lost in ups outer space for several weeks and finally after dozens of calls on my part the second half finally arrived.  The problem is the second half did not match the 1st half.  As of today I have half a bed in white wood and the other in expresso.  Zulilly representatives are some of the nicest most empathetic customer reps I've ever spoke to.  Thing is nothing ever gets done.  It is all talk.  For 3 weeks I've been told, there would be a correct shipment in the next 7 days or a refund.  Today, months after ordering and weeks after receiving the wrong box 2 of 2, all they can tell me is sorry we are waiting to hear from the vendor/shipper.  Horrible experience.

VI agree with the other reviewers. About half of the stuff I have bought I have kept. You really have to research the items before buying. Check prices on Amazon. Sometimes they are higher than amazon. No name brands can sometimes be good but sometimes they are poor quality. Especially if the prices are really low, they could be poor quality. And they do charge shipping... And they do take 2 weeks to ship. And there are no returns. So I only buy things I am not concerned about fit. But. I have been taken before: bought some cool shirts that came back huge... Had to try to alter them. Lately I have not found much worth buying with them. Usually these are Marshalls items that a brand is trying to get rid of. But sometimes you can find something special that's worth buying.

The picture was so adorable I ordered my daughter two pairs. I also saw a pre school rocks dress that was adorable as well. My daughter wears a toddler size 9 in shoes, so of course that's what I ordered. The moccassins came in the mail and were huge. They were so big that my son who wears a toddler 11 1/2 could fit them. No sense in sending them back so I told my daughter she could use them for slippers. The dress however, has still yet to come in. It has been over a month, and the website still says in transit to zulily. I ordered it for her to wear the first day of school which is Wed., and the customer service rep said it wouldn't be in so I canceled. I had no idea they wait to order from a company.

VI ordered a two battery operated cars for my grandson and granddaughter for Christmas. I ordered them in plenty of time and Zulily said they were going to be delivered before Christmas. However, only my granddaughter's car arrived.  I had to spend many hours researching what happened. They finally admitted the larger car for my grandson was lost and they would deliver another one. It wasn 't delivered until mid-January when I was already in Florida. When I returned in late March, we opened both packages and put the cars together. My grandson's car weren't take a charge. They told us to replace the battery. That didn't work. I notified Zulily and they told me they couldn't help me. To add insult to injury they gave me a $15 credit for a car that cost me $120!! I took it to an electrician and he said they was something seriously wrong with the wiring. I haven't ordered anything since - I'm afraid I will get junk again!

VI ordered a dress, size 8, which had a fitted waist line.  When I received it, I couldn't even get it over my head/shoulders, much less on.  It has no zipper, which is a ridiculous design for this dress.  It certainly is not true to size.  My daughter, who is a 0-2, could barely get it on.\u000a\u000aWhen I contacted them to complain, I was told that I would receive a store credit but not a refund.  They indicate that they are a "final sales" website.  I pointed out to them that this was an error/flaw in the dress and advertised size, not simply because I didn't like it.  They refused to budge.  A store credit does me no good since I will never shop with them again!

VAwful return policy & customer service!  Bought 2 swim suits for my 3 year old and after FINALLY receiving them 3 weeks later they were completely inappropriate and didn't even cover her chest properly.  I called to see if I could return them and they could careless about the situation and told me they don't accept returns on swim wear as they consider it "intimate apparel".  I understand what they're saying but these didn't even come close to fitting and how do they not allow a return on clothing items that we buy sight unseen and we're unable to try them on until we receive them in the mail??

The shoes were fine, as I have owned that brand before, HOWEVER...the dresses were paper thin, cheap quality, and smaller than the average "small". I have swimsuit cover-ups that are better quality than these 2 dresses. I would NEVER wear this poor quality to the beach or pool, much less to work or out to dinner. Pathetic, I would rather wear a disposable paper gown from the doctor's office over these poorly made items, at least it's free & the material is about the same!!!

VI have never had a pleasant shopping experience with Zulily.Customer service responds with same scripted answers.\u000a\u000aThey kept shipping orders to my old address even though I changed my address with them. Would e-mail them before anything ever shipped to tell them you have the wrong address. Customer service would respond ohh we will fix that right away. They of course never did some orders I never received others I paid a total of an extra $30 to get them from the post office making their crappy products not worth any discount they offer.\u000a\u000aSo I switch e-mail address to give them one more chance why I'm a sucker I guess?. Ordered a swing set for our daughter's second birthday, her grandparents wanted to get it for her:. I get an e-mail saying you may have received an e-mail saying your order was canceled don't worry it isn't once we receive it we will ship it right to you:. I e-mail them asking them why I got this e-mail and if everything was ok with my order and if we would be receiving the swing set!.\u000a\u000aGot a response yes it is just fine it is in stock and available to ship on the 8th,. Today is the 8th just got an e-mail saying your order has been canceled we don't have it in stock sorry for the inconvenience". Seriously!!! So my daughters birthday is Monday I had to scramble to find the same swing set to get herald fast/.\u000a\u000aThank god for Amazon shipped for free in two days and about $60 cheaper:.Stay far far away from zulily you will be disappointed every single time.

VWHERE DO I START!\u000aBottom line THEY TRIED TAKING MONEY FROM MY BANK ACCOUNTS WITHOUT ME EVEN HAVING AN ORDER WITH THEM COSTING ME $70!!\u000a\u000a1) I have had many orders with them thinking they're stuff is really cute. It is!\u000aHowever when I order a pink dress and it turns out purple, it's disappointing. I got my daughter brown boots that came in this awful off white color. I didn't even want her wearing them!\u000a\u000a2) "Ships within 5-12 days" BS! I had 3 orders take over a month before they even processed it! This was September 1-10th I placed the orders, did not receive any until October 20. I have no problem waiting but do not advertise that kind of shipping.\u000a\u000a3) When the website was down (no problem! I understand it happens!) I politely called and placed my order over the phone :) got a confirmation number and was excited for my husbands birthday present to come in the mail! Until I got the email. The woman used an old outdated bank card on my account NOT the one I gave her and she even read it back to me! It was sold out at that point and that was the one thing I wanted to get him, it was rare to come by, and I did not find a replacement for his birthday. I was disappointed. But they did credit my Zulily account. I thought maybe I would get him something for Christmas from there.\u000a\u000a4) I placed an order with my store credit and got an email that the order was placed charged to my bank account not the store credit. I patiently call in and the man helped me cancel my order and place it with my store credit.\u000a\u000a5) With that order placed I then had free shipping until Sunday at midnight, right? WRONG! It even said "Free shipping" on my account but it was no where to be found when I was checking out!\u000a\u000a6)!!!!! Since I NEVER placed that "free shipping" order, I thought I was dodging a huge bullet if I never shipped there again! WRONG! WITH NO ORDERS PLACED, I found my bank account in the negative. I have a bank statement showing all kinds of attempts from ZULILY>:( for amounts from $15 to $8 to $2! I never imagined zulily would have 10 attempts of collecting all kinds of amounts from me for NO ORDER! In the end this costed me $70! That's $70 I do not have! That's $70 I have nothing to show for! ZULILY IS A RIP OFF!

Whether it's the undefined timeline to receive a product, to adult women's size clothing really arriving in teen sizes, to just plain ole cheap quality. It is really a negative wash.

The korks sandals that i ordered for around $32 which was originally around 70 bucks was cheaply made and i could say fake. They maybe using pictures of the original branded items but the ones that they're selling are fake items. It's fraud.

I have not had to make a call to customer service in over 3 years. I called Zulily today and the customer service SUPERVISOR SCOTT was unbelievably rude. He basically said "Oh, well" and perhaps I am not the kind of person who should buy from them. I suppose it is wealthy folks who don't care if they ever get the items or not. I am a hard working person and I think anything over two weeks is basically not acceptable. I run two businesses online. I offer free shipping and priority mail.

One of my friends who order from my link 2 days later(whom I didn't get any credit for) also received partial shipment and an email saying some of her items were no longer available but would be upgraded. Today she received an email after waiting 3 weeks that they cancelled her order!!!! They are going to give her a $10 credit for her trouble!! Seriously?? In the form of store credit!!!!

VFirst of all, it IS possible to get great deals on things here. That being said, there is just no organization. I've placed 4 orders with this company over the last 4 months. 2 of which were messed up.  The first sent me the wrong color leggings and then of course could not resend them because the event was over.  The next order I was informed (after 5 weeks) that the purse I had ordered would not be shipping to me.  I was refunded and given a $10 voucher but $10??? This seems trivial and do I really want to go through the process of ordering more and waiting to see if anything will come? Not likely.  They could have kept the $10, if you have a retail business, at least provide the products purchased to your customers. With the problems with the orders, they have only a 50% success rate.  So if you order something with them, flip a coin.  That is a good indicator of whether you will actually get your items or not.  But you will probably have to wait for a month and a half to find out.

At the 4.5 week mark I inquired about shipping on the purchase (i.e. where is this item? I know it usually takes 3-4 weeks). At this point I was told that they are unable to fulfill each purchase and they are sorry for not notifying me (at all). This is very frustrating, what a waste of time! They sell you items that their retailers don't have in stock and then fail to notify you about it! So you think you got a nice deal and are waiting on a needed item that will never arrive. Take your business somewhere else! If this happened to me twice in 6 weeks on 2 separate orders, it must be happening all the time.

VBeware of this website! So today I was shopping at zulily and they were selling clothing from orange zone inc. This is a wholesale website out of china. Zulily was asking 12 dollars for the sweater I was about to order, while the wholesale websites lists the price as 8. First of all wholesale clothing is usually cheap quality and second I can't believe Zulily is trying to make a profit by selling these types of clothes in the first place. I will take my business somewhere else!

VAt first I loved this site. I was ordering like crazy and referring tons of people. I earned $80 in credits from referrals. Two of the people I referred had major problems and now I feel responsible. One of the people I referred had her order cancelled after waiting over a month for the merchandise. Zulilly gave her a $10 credit, but she is pissed. The other person had to wait a month and a half for her merchandise to arrive and when it came a pair of jeans ordered for her daughter were in bad shape. The stitching on the seams was coming undone and the embroidery on the back pockets was unfinished. Zulilly credited her account $7.95, which was the shipping costs. They should have credited her card instead of store credit. Ridiculous! Then my nightmare began! A pair of boots I ordered fell apart the second time I wore them and now I\u2019m waiting on an order for my daughter\u2019s birthday that late shipping out. Today is her birthday, so it looks like it will not arrive in time :(  Zulilly return policy is nonexistent, the shipping costs are ridiculous, and the quality is horrible! Better off going to TJ Maxx, Loehmann\u2019s or searching ebay!

VMy first few orders from Zulily were high quality and shipped within a reasonable time period (less than a month).  Since then, every order has had a major problem -- the wrong item was shipped, deliveries were delayed for months, expensive merchandise was of poor quality (think Forever 21) or merchandise arrived damaged/broken.  I have received store credit for some of the items, but no longer want to shop there and would like refunds on my most recent delivery.

VI ordered a dress for my daughter. They charged my CC right away and I waited 3 weeks for it to be shipped. It had finally been received by Zulily and was supposed to ship out to me. All of a sudden Zulily canceled my order for NO REASON! I called my CC company and they refunded my money but nowhere did Zulily say there was any type of problem with my order. I won't be ordering from them again. The shipping times are ridiculous to say the least but I figured it was a beautiful dress so I'd deal with it but to wait 3 weeks for nothing is just aggravating.

And when I e-mailed to inquire about the status I get an e-mail saying they had problems processing my payment.  Hmmm, that's funny because I can see where they charged my account.  There was an item that I was considering buying, but then when I did a search to see if I could find the item cheaper elsewhere I found that both Target AND Walmart had the identical item for less.  And I KNOW they won't take almost 3 weeks to ship my stuff.

VThis has to be one of the WORST "discount" shopping sites ever!  I've ordered several things from them.  I've tried to love them but they make it impossible.  First, their "standard" shipping time is 2-3 weeks.  What they don't tell you is that is the time the item is shipped from the place THEY are getting it.  The items are shipped to them and then THEY ship it to you (they must buy in bulk).  So you are looking at 6-8 STANDARD time for you to get your order - I'm still waiting (been 10 weeks now) for something I ordered.  Of course, they charge your credit card the day you order something.  Also, there are NO RETURNS or REFUNDS of any kind on their items.  If you don't like it or it doesn't fit, too bad.  It's really not worth the hassle unless it's something you KNOW you will love and you don't care if it takes 3 months to get it.

VIf I could rate it zero I would. INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS: be prepared to wait over a month for your order. I order from many flash websites in the states and this isn't a surprise, nor is it my complaint. For starters, the website charged my account and then claims that they do a "reversal of funds" within 72 hours, just to make sure you have the money in your account or that it exists (???!) and then charges your account again when the items individually ship. Wtf! Just take my money and send my stuff when it comes in like every other site! The reversal of funds never went through and after an hour on the phone with my bank, they completed an investigation and a week later (over  MONTH after the initial transaction) my money was finally returned. Worst of all, customer service kept sending me the same email (in different words) telling me it was all to do with my bank and nothing to do with them and I had to deal with them CHARGING ME TWICE for all of the merchandise. At the end of the "investigation", it was them who never submitted the reversal. Fancy that. Secondly, when I finally received my package it wasn't mine, wrong packing slip and all. Are you kidding me?? I'm now waiting for a reply from customer service so I can waste more time submitting a return and then waiting another month for my stuff to come. NEVER AGAIN!!

Surprisingly the accounts are not connected if you later sign in with the same email that they send you spam to.After being told that they could not find my account I had to dig it up myself. Later I noticed one of the items I had ordered had been "cancelled" after it never showed up. I did not cancel the item nor was I ever told my email or anything else that the order would not arrive. Also I was not refunded. I emailed them again and even told the guy that last time they couldn't find my account ,so I took a screen shot and sent them my order #. if the guy emails me back saying they will refund me with store credit I am going to blow my lid. I want my money back and furthermore I will not be spending anymore of my hard earned money at this worthless shop. they can't even tell you when your items will arrive,actually they pretend you don't exist as a customer. As a web designer, I can see that whoever is handling the customer accounts is a total baboon. If they cannot connect an email to a Facebook account they have no business telling people they can sign in with Facebook.

It's ridiculous the amount of time the shippment stays "in transit" when you check your order status.  I placed my order on June 1st and it's now June 20th.  My order has been "in transit" for almost 3 wks now, when it states on the website that it should ship in 10-14 days.  This site is a rack of bull$#*!.  I will never order for zulily again.

First of all they want you to give all your personal information when signing up just to view their page, second they will SELL the hell out of your name and address if you order anything from them. I got LOADS of junk mail sent to my email and to my home address that I would have never otherwise received. Third- their shipping takes FOREVER. I ordered two dresses for my little girl, one had a sun hat included. My credit card was immediately debited for the entire purchase plus shipping. I was under the impression that I would be getting my items within 7-10 business days. WRONG. I got ONE of the dresses 6 weeks later after a ton of calls to their lousy customer service department, then I got the hat to the second dress 2 weeks later- ONLY the hat. I called them up and really gave them a piece of my mind and I was told I'd be getting my second item asap. I did not get the second dress for another 3 weeks. 9 weeks??? My little girl had pretty much grown out of these. I'd give them 0 stars but that's not an option on here.

VI was skeptical about Zulily, and signed up over a year ago but never used it. After having wonderful experiences shopping online with OTHER places, I decided to give them a try because they had such cute items and decent prices for a poor mother and wife like me. I enjoy getting things for my baby girl, like I never really had, and with college graduation half a year away, I figured I'd just keep pampering her and she'd never even know what condition we were in before. Well...this was not pampering. I saw the delivery time. That wasn't really an issue. They delivered the items when they said they would (2 weeks from May 3th, today I got the items). My problem is what I got. I paid 70 dollars for all this. Shoes were adorable... handkerchief top was adorable, but the shoes are slightly too big and shorts were ABSOLUTELY too small! I have a very tiny 16 month old. She is wearing 12 month old clothing. The shorts were so tight on her that it looked like her legs would cease to have good circulation any second. They might fit a 3 month old, but not a 12 month old. ALSO, they charged my account 2 WEEKS later! I was explained to by a customer service rep that they put a hold on the account first, then charge when it actually ships. No where on their website does it say this for your own forewarning. Had I known about it, MAYBE I wouldn't have gone out and bought groceries, or helped my sister with her high school graduation :). Oh wait, maybe I actually wouldn't have ordered! Yeah, that's it! Now my account is over drafted, because they are charging me the second time around, not the first. I thought it had already cleared. Don't think I'll be doing this again. I'll stick to mainstream clothing stores online...whose products I trust.

V1. It took one month to get my order\u000a2. All the clothes and products are cheap and most made in China and then sold by a private seller to make a profit\u000a3. If you want to buy items like Zulily, wait for a month, and pay a small fraction of the price, buy directly from China via a site such as www.yoybuy.com. It's a little complicated, but worth it\u000a4. Really, the sales and discounts are completely made up - do a price comparison - just another lie

VI have never actually ordered anything from this site but I have worked in customer service at zulily for a short time. First off, they make a habit of advertising products hey don't have. They order just enough so they are sure they can sell out and not any more. As a result, customers end up ordering product that is not in stock. \u000a\u000aShipping is built around saving the company money at the customer's expense. Typically they send the order to the vendor who sends the order to the warehouse then the product is shipped out via UPS to a post office which ships via USPS to the customer's house (in a month....if they're lucky). If that sounds ridiculously complicated that's because it is especially considering that the customer pays for shipping.\u000a\u000aAs for customer service being horrible, I agree. When "training" me they crammed a week of customer service training into 1 day! Needless to say I had no idea how to answer customer questions when the time came to answer phone calls.\u000a\u000aAfter a few weeks of being berated for 8 hours a day by angry customers I quit...and I'm glad I did! This company has terrible training, shipping and their policies are the antithesis of good customer service.

VThis is by far the worst experience I have ever had with an online merchant - I ordered 3 dresses as a gift for my cousin's baby who was celebrating her first birthday. The website asked if it was a gift and I said "YES" - well, the ordering and paying was easy enough... no problem there. The problem is it took over a week to even get a shipment notification, then when I got it, it came in 3 different tracking numbers - 1 package for each dress. Now, let me ask you this - if you are the recipient of this gift, and got 1 dinky dress, you would said "oh yeah right" but the objective was to give all three dresses together to make a "wow - thats a beautiful gift, all 3 in different colors and designs, how lovely"... so now, my cousin will get each dress separately thinking what a cheap shopper I am ... not to mention it was shipped a week after the order and then another week for the product to get there!!! What a horrible shopping experience - stay away from this site.

VAs a vendor selling products to them, they are dishonest, and very underhanded. Claimed we didn't fulfill their products on the order, we double checked with our warehouse, now they told us we did fulfill it, but sent the wrong items in, (but they weren't going to tell us this until we challenged them that we did send it the products), and now they are doing chargebacks for items they didn't even have on their inventory. They DO NOT HOLD inventory, so that's why products are late to their customers. They basically make money prior to paying their vendors, claim they didn't receive stock, has back charges for products they don't even have in the inventory, and makes tons of money without ever giving up capital.

And I live in Philadelphia (center city) so there is no reason it would be easier for USPS to deliver. That, and there are no returns.

I took it out of the bag to wrap and the other side looked horrendous. It looked ragged, pilled, like an old blanket. It looked like something out of goodwill. They made one side beautiful and completely cheaped out on the other side. I don't understand how they can sell such shoddy items.  I had to immediately go to a baby boutique and buy something more suitable.  I'm so glad I looked at the other side of the blanket, I would have been mortified if I had given this as a present.

I inquired as to why my order was going on three weeks before even being "transferred" to Zulily for shipping to me and they just vaguely blamed it on the manufacturer.  A week later, I received an email that they'd be unable to fulfill my order (took that long to learn that??) and offered me $10 as compensation.  Hilarious since their basic rate shipping is $6.  Thanks for the big $4 "credit," Zulily.  Don't bother with this site, it's not worth it.

VNever again!  The order took FOREVER to arrive.  When it finally did it was absolute junk.  I purchased girls' dresses that were allegedly priced at $60-80 each for a sale price of $20 each, thinking I was getting a bargain.  What a joke.  The dresses looked like something off the dollar store rack.  The fabric was thin and had a rough texture.  The lace was incredibly shabby and cheap.  I'll never buy from Zulily again.

VAlthough I am not as enthusiastically angry right now as some other reviewers were when they left their comments, I still very much feel their pain. Zulily really rides the "scam" line. You think it's great to pay 40-50% off on some really nice items, but the headache of the transaction is really not worth the savings. Trust me. Find coupons or wait until the actual company has a close-out or clearance.\u000a\u000aMy story is so extremely similar to almost every other negative review here (hm, coincidence?). I had been a member of the site for months before I decided to purchase anything. There was a nice sale on some Crocs, so I decided to pick up two pair - one for myself, and one for my son. A month after I placed the order, I decide to email customer service as I had not received the shipment, nor any notification that it was on its way. I was originally told the items would be shipped in 10-14 business days. The customer service rep emailed me back and so poignantly reminded me that it is "business days". And just like most everyone has said here, that translates into about 3-4 weeks. And you pay something like $8 for shipping, too! (What a rip!) Anyway, that would be one thing, and I can honestly say that I wouldn't totally mind that if you actually received the items, etc. What's interesting is that they process the transaction (i.e. take your money) right when you order the items, not when they ship them. (Like I said, painfully close to the scam line here.) Now here's the kicker, I wait about 5-6 weeks before I receive one pair of shoes, my son's. Great. Finally. Thank you. (And as most people have said - yes, by the time we finally received them, he had nearly outgrown them.) But now where are the other shoes I purchased? I had gotten the habit of checking my order status daily by now, so I sign into my account to see that the other shoe order's status was "canceled". Weird, I never received notice of that. So I emailed customer service once again. A response came back, assuring me that my order was not canceled. Another few days go by and I receive an email from customer service. "Unfortunately" they were not able to obtain the shoes I originally ordered so they were sending me a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT pair. Really? Who the hell does business this way? So I can order something, pay for it immediately, wait a quarter of a year and THEN find out that they can't give it to me and thus send me something completely different? That's gambling, basically, and nowhere on their site am I told that that is how my money/order would be handled. I responded back to this email with just about the same tone I am using here. They apologized and did refund my money and even said I could keep the (really ugly) replacement shoes that were being sent to me. I was surprised at this since they clearly state that your order is non-refundable. So they get one star for responding to my emails in a timely manner and actually resolving matters (for the most part). But overall, buyer BEWARE. Steer clear of this company unless you actually enjoy frustration.

VI'm not a big reviewer of anything, but my two experiences with Zulily compelled me to actually seek out a place online to warn potential customers before ordering from this sham of a site. \u000aBasically, I had the same experience as everyone else here that left a negative review: LOOOOONG shipping times, missing items with no warning, hard to get refunded (even on items that I never received), HORRIBLE customer service (once I finally got a refund it was for a product I never ordered, which was also cheaper--how convenient), etc, etc.\u000aI really wanted to like this site. I sent it to all my family members in anticipation of my first child. I have since sent everyone I know emails telling them to never order from Zulily. \u000aSave yourself a lot of headaches and avoid Zulily.com

Noooo, will they refund my money...NO!!! Did it finally ship out after I contacted them yesterday. Miraculously yes!! Now I don't have money to throw down the drain, but I have no Christmas presents for my family members now and have to run out and get some cheap fillers as my budget is blown. I told them that, they said chuck you farley! Well you know what I mean. They are horrid and so far my order is due to arrive sometime around January 5th according to the tracking number that I've received. They are SOOOOO WRONG!!! Protect yourself, don't order.

It was delivered from UPS to the post office five days ago and there it sits.  I paid all this money to have it delivered from UPS!  Why is it sitting in the post office?  There is no way that my granddaughter will get this for Christmas. I have emailed Zulilly and have received no response from them.  Theri customer service sucks.

You'll get a refund within a few days and a paltry $10 credit towards another purchase. We go out of town and stay with family for Christmas so I shop online and have items sent there. This is the first time I've used zulily, After getting this message I called to find out what has and hasn't arrived at my family's home and apparently only half has come.

VI wish I had the opportunity read the reviews on this site before ordering from Zulily on the advice of a friend.  While it appears they have "really great deals" on paper, you really need to consider if the wait and potential for disappointment are worth the so-called "bargain". I ordered 4 items 2 weeks ago, and just received an e-mail saying 2 of my 4 items aren't available, and the other 2 are still in line for being packaged and shipped.  I'm hoping I receive them before I'm supposed to gift them at Christmas time, but I'm not holding my breath since it's more likely that I'm going to receive another e-mail telling me my other items also aren't available.  In the meantime, I've already purchased backup gifts for those two members of my family.  In this day and age, that sort of turnaround time is absolutely unacceptable.  \u000a\u000aThen they try to give me a $10 credit at the website - like I'm really going to EVER use them again.

VMy first order took a month to receive and I was disappointed in the quality but thought it was just a fluke and ordered again.  Wrong!!!!  I have received 3 of the 6 items I ordered in mid October and every item has been just plain crappy!  The stuffed rocking chair horse was super cheap looking and the sound did not work, the outfit I ordered for a very skinny 7 year old girl came with a skirt that was too tight even on my 1 year old toddler and a top that was too big on the 7 year old.  And, Zulily had advised me that there had been a fabric change on the skirt from a chennile to flannel--I wish I had canceled then because the flannel is thin  and cheap and looks like left-over night gown fabric from a dollar store.  The third item was from the manufacturer Nanette--I used to be a department store girl's buyer and am very familiar with the brand and this dress DOES NOT LOOK LIKE NANETTE despite the label--it has to be a second or special make.  So disappointed--the web site pictures look so good but obviously the the quality is lacking.  I am deleting their daily emails and advising friends not to make purchases from Zulily.

VUpdate: just realised one of the shirts has a masisive hole in the sleeve seam. Thankfully i know how to sew, so i can fix it. But i can't believe they ship this stuff out and expect happy customers! Lowering my review to one star...\u000a\u000aIt took me almost TWO MONTHS to receive my entire order. The first shipment came about 5 weeks after I ordered, which they sent me the wrong sizes. Thankfully though they were bigger so I can use them later as my daughter grows so I didn't have to get involved with customers service. I was still missing a shirt, and I got it two weeks later.  Really, I don't understand why shipping takes so long. And I got. The wrong size, but luckily I can still use it later.

VI finally received my order today after a month and a half.  I ordered three SWAK brand dresses for my 3 year old granddaughter in size 3 and a 'cupcake' outfit consisting of a top and tights.  The cupcake outfit would fit a five year old quite nicely, but not a three year old.  The other SWAK dresses were cute, but rather cheap.  At least they fit her.  I also received two additional dresses which I did not order, but was charged for.  So ultimately I received three dresses that were exactly the same--a kitty cat motif.  I guess I'll have to give the two I don't need away as gifts to other children because you can't return.  I will NEVER shop from this site again.

VAs many other customers said - horrible, horrible shopping experience! Takes forever to receive your order and that's if you're lucky and your items in fact are available. They never let you know if the items you've ordered aren't available or if your order has been cancelled, so you're left to wait for 14 business days, which is almost 3 weeks, just to find out that your order never has been fulfilled. They didn't charge me before shipping, so I didn't need a refund, but still this whole hassle convinced me to shop elsewhere... Moreover, stuff they sell has very nice descriptions and pictures, but no reviews, so I always go on Amazon to read reviews before placing an order, and most of the items I've researched didn't even have good reviews alltogether... Doesn't even make sense to bother. Amazon or Overstock are much more reliable, allow returns and super fast shipping, and most of the time have the same items for the same price!

Also, quality is not that great.  Ordered some simple cotton outfits (dress/leggings) for my kids and the cotton was very thin (see through).  Also, the sizing seems to be off.  Perhaps that is just this particular manufacturer.  I do a lot of online shopping, but I will now only do so from reputable sites.  I wish I had read these reviews before I placed my order.

They gave me a 10 dollar credit. Gee thanks. About a week later some pajamas I ordered for my kids and they were covered in black ink! They said they had extras and would send me a pjs. So they could not get enough inventory of the luggage I ordered but they have plenty of pajamas? Whatever system they use isn't working. I filed a complaint with BBB and nothing has been resolved. Avoid this site if you know what's good for you.

Vhave to agree with everyone's negative review here.  Great bargins but at a risky price.  Order two boots size 13...received a 12 (yup they didn't fit).  Then ordered another pair for daughter #2 size 10...got two left boots but they were a size 10.  \u000a\u000aYou can tell they are getting the bottom of the barrel in their selection.  \u000a\u000aAlso it took me over 6 weeks to get our summer items something to remember if you are ordering for the current season.  \u000a\u000aAlso recieved two cheesy girl dresses that I didn't order that they tried to pawn off as the dresses that I did ordered.  \u000a\u000aNot getting anywhere with customer service and my girl friend actually knows the owner of the company :(

VOn June 27th I ordered a pair of shoes for my grand-daughter.  It's now July 22nd and no shoes have arrived.  I contacted them after 2 weeks and they told me they don't ship for 14 BUSINESS days.  That meant almost 3 weeks.  They shipped it via a strange UPS service that then delivered it to the local post office for delivery to my home.  The package has been sitting at the Sacramento post office since July 18th.  What type of shipping do they pay for???  The price I paid for shipping should have given me priority shipping.  My grand-daughter will probably not fit in the shoes by the time they come.  I will NEVER order from this site again, as the customer service is the worst I've ever encountered.

The site says 10-14 days which I would have been okay with.  I sure hope they do not give me grief about the return.  I made comments on their facebook site and also via email and got a generated auto response both times.  I have a feeling they are going to give me store credit for my returns which means I will have to order something for my baby that is due in 5 months instead of maternity clothes because that is how long it will take to receive it!

VI wish I had seen this site before ordering from them for the second time.  I assumed the first time, when the order took about a month (maybe even longer, as I'd almost forgotten about it by the time it finally arrived), that it was a fluke.  I bought the customer service line about it taking a little longer because they are receiving from a source and have to wait for that before they ship out to us, but that is the way we get the discount.  By the way, the discount is not so great, when adding on shipping.\u000aSince that was over 6 months ago, I forgot my negative feeling and giving them the benefit of the doubt, placed another order a month ago.  I guess I'll be lucky if the bathing suits and rash guards arrive before summer ends.  People with babies less than a year old should NOT order anything unless ordering 2 sizes ahead because by the time they get the order the baby will have long outgrown the items!

They were all from the same vendor and would be a great gift. I indicated on the order that it was a gift. The problem was that the gifts came in 4 separate shipments. How embarrassing!

VFirst off, Zulily is very upfront about their shopping plan on their site. It takes a long time. I think some people are not reading this before ordering. The shipping times are very inconsistent. The reason I'm not ordering from them again is because of how they charge for what you buy. It's a confusing PITA. When you order,  they charge you (authorization). Next,  you'll see a reversal. Then when you're item actually ships,  you'll see another charge. This is asinine. Nobody else I deal with she's this. You are charged when your item ships,  period!  No authorizing and reversals;  if your card I'd declined,  your ish doesn't ship,  plain and simple! Zulily took a good idea and made it horrible. Just avoid unless you see a really good deal,  but be prepared for the shipping wait and credit card shenanigans.

VI've bought infant clothes from Zulily for the past 6 months. The site has great deals on brands that I would not choose to buy at full price. I have not been as impressed with the women's cloths and household items sold. The quality and styles of those items appear to be mediocre. \u000a\u000aMy two main complaints:\u000a1. Items do not arrive until a month after they're ordered. It's hard to understand how the process can be so slow. Thus is particularly problematic with infant clothes (and Zulily offers a lot of them), I've not infrequently received something I ordered that no longer fits my baby. \u000a2. Descriptions and pictures are not complete. I ordered some infant pants only to discover they had a huge logo splashed across the back - not something I would have wanted had I realized. To Zulily's credit, they credited me back the cost of the pants without even making me return the pants (all items are non-returnable).  Since then I've been very cautious about what I buy and avoid items that don't have complete pictures or descriptions (which are many).

VI bought from Zulily for about 2 years off and on. Although you get good deals on some items, most of the clothes are of poor quality(some brand name kitchen items not too bad). The one thing I found the most disturbing is the misleading pictures. I bought a little scully cap for my infant. The picture and discription had no mention of a ball on the top of it. When I recieved the product there was a ball of 100%FUR on top! I am anti-fur so this was very upsetting.  I stopped buying from them altogether.

After contacting customer service they tell me " I'm sorry you were never contacted but, your order of this/these items was canceled because of a stocking issue."  So, I was sitting here waiting on stuff that would never come. This did not happen once, but twice in the last two months.  I will not be shopping with them again.  Most of the time stuff they have on their site is the same price on amazon anyway.  Very disappointed .  Would not suggest ordering from them at all.

VI ordered a shirt for a sudden wedding (sudden in the sense that my idiot brother didn't plan his wedding until the last minute, and I was scrambling to find proper clothes in a short period while living on an island without any real stores).  My sister found this for me and ordered it without checking out the site.  \u000a\u000aThe shirt is lovely.  It looks great, but I'm not exactly impressed with the site itself.\u000a\u000aThe shirt arrived in a shipping bag with the shirt basically just shoved in a ball inside.  If I hadn't already planned to wash it first, I'd certainly have had to iron it before wear, but the real problem was the fact that one entire sleeve was covered in some kind of stain, like the shirt was rubbed against a tire or something.  The stains are fairly bad, though I'm hoping they'll wash out, as I'm out of time and don't have a choice.\u000a\u000aThe shirt also doesn't have any tags.  At all.  As in, when I wash this, I won't know how to do it, because even the tags that usually have washing information are missing.  That's...questionable.  \u000a\u000aIf I can wash the shirt, I'll write it off as a narrow escape and just not order from this company again.  I don't want to bother with a company that doesn't do any quality check whatsoever, because this stain wasn't easy to miss.  Someone had to have either seen it or put the shirt on some objectionable surface before packaging.  Either way, not good enough for me.\u000a\u000aTwo stars because I really do like the shirt, and ordering wasn't difficult.  Minus three stars for stains and missing tags and questionable quality.

VApparently there is no quality control at Zulily. Recently, I increased by orders b/c I needed fall clothing for my daughter, who just started school. Unless you purchase a nationally-recognized brand, DON'T ORDER! The sizing is weird, the clothing is made of low-quality fabric, there are tears, holes, seams coming apart, and recently, a holiday inflatable decoration lost its first blower in 7 days, 2 days later, the 2nd went out. No exchanges. If you complain you might get a refund for the defective item, but not the 2 matching tops for which you now have no matching leggings! There customer service reps seem to be trained to placate customers, but they really need to get a handle on the quality issues up front and stop shipping out damaged merchandise. I don't know if their vendors are shipping their seconds because there are no exchanges, or if Zulily's buyers are not paying attention to what they order for sale. And it has gone downhill recently. The shipping wait is completely inexcusable.

My second experience made me realize that I fell for their silly scheme.     They make you think you're getting something special and uncommon,  BAIT.    They make you sign up prior to viewing their inventory,  GOTCHA.    Then, they make you pay for clothing they don't even have in stock,  then, order it on your behalf,  hoping and praying someone doesn't make a mistake, and then, you wait and wait and wait and wait.   It could take several weeks to realize something is wrong, meanwhile, they have your money.    Oh, what a scam!   Amazon.com, Overstock.com and all the others are far superior.   Zulily doesn't accept returns, they inundated you with email blasts, and they make you wait for an entiriy for your purchase.   This seems like an archaic way to do business these days.

VUpdate- Oct 8th I recieved the rest of my order- 5 weeks and 1 day later... I only had to complain once ;-)---  The worst quality yet...  I wish I had the two or three week shipping they advertise, but it has been 4 weeks and my items still haven't even SHIPPED!  I ordered some sweater dresses for my daughter which she will probably outgrow before they arrive.  I also ordered a dress for myself, which arrived after 15 days but was 2 sizes smaller than the size chart which I carefully checked before ordering.  I also received the shirt I ordered but it is cheap & small & SEE-THROUGH!  It was not see through on the picture!  These items are non-returnable for a reason... everyone would return them.  The quality is poor when you actually receive them & the size is simply not correct, even though they list a size chart next to each item. I just received the brand name shirt I ordered for my son (I went to the local department store and tried on shirts with him to ensure the proper size first) and it was sooooo long it looked like a dress (my son is skinny and almost 6 feet tall so usually kids shirts are too short).  He was laughing so hard he was crying 'cause it looked so WRONG.   If you are looking for trinkets, this site might work but don't be in a hurry- 2 months is evidently a reasonable time frame for them.

VZulilly takes experience to really get a deal. There are so many things to do in order to make sure you are actually getting a deal and buying something of decent quality. Comments from other reviewers are helpful if you want to shop this site. I am sorely disappointed with the merchandise. I looked at all the pics and read the description. It was not the advertised material! The item is okay but I would not have bought it at an off the rack store and I definitely would not have paid what I paid. You can't take the website description

VI know, and I agree ~ I would be really careful about what you order, even if it's a brand name.  Check amazon.com as another suggested to see how that style really stacks up in how it looks or feels from customers on *that* site or another unbiased site to get a feel for the product.  Be careful of sizing although my shoes I have gotten are great so far, just do the buyer beware check on things first.\u000a\u000aThat said, I may have been lucky so far, knock on wood.  I know it takes forever, but you can check on when your order is shipping/has shipped on their website under your account.  Everyone commented on my new $20 shoes liking them.  I also ordered a maxi skirt and that was nice looking too, and about the same price.  I put together a whole outfit on there from shirt to shoes and had good luck.  I just reordered again and if my satisfaction goes down I will update on here.  I think it's some parts luck, some parts research, and some parts patience that makes an order you will be satisfied with.  Good luck!

VMust also chime in with the incredible wait time on items.  I ordered some items on July 17th, it is now 2 August and I am still waiting on the items!  I am now afraid of what I might get based on some other customer reviews.  It is true that you can find their items on other sites for the same price or a little higher.  It has been so long since I placed the order I actually forgot what my items looked like so I did a search using the name of the items from the tracking info.  I found each thing I ordered from Zulily on other sites, most of them at the same price without the WEEKS LONG wait time.  I have had things frieght forwarded (domestic shipping then international shipping) from the US to Central America that arrived at my door step in less time than it has taken Zulily to ship domestically.\u000a\u000aUpdate: It's Monday 5 August.  Delivery status update says my package has been delivered but I have no merchandise.  Delivery time was at 7:52 PM on Saturday, you read that right 8PM on a Saturday.  I called Zulily to inform them that although the package says delivered I never recieved the items and that I thought the delivery time was quite odd.  I was informed by Zulily customer service that it is common for items NOT YET DELIVERED to be marked delivered and that I should wait a few more days to see if I recieve my package.  If I don't receive my already marked delivered package in a few days, I will have to wait 10 additional days for any hope of a refund.  The 10 additional days are so they can declare it lost in the mail.

VIF you receive the merchandise it's very nice and the price is good.  I was charged for a pair of shoes that my size turned out to be unavailable after all, even though my order was accepted  Never saw the credit on my Visa.  If I'd ordered something pricey I'd be pissed.  There's no way to contact Zulilly to rectify the situation and you don't know who the vendor is and can't contact them either.  I don't think my card should be charged UNTIL PRODUCT SHIPS. It seems all correspondence from Zulilly is "No-reply".   Be aware that if you order several items at the same time they will all ship independently, varying vendors/ locations. That's OK, as long as it ships.  BUYER BEWARE!!

VAlthough I cannot speak to the quality of the merchandise, BECAUSE I HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT STILL, I can tell you NOT to order anything that is time sensitive. I placed an order on 7/9/13 and still have not received it. It appears that the items were sent for shipping on 7/19/13; 10 days after paid order. The website explains the shipping process so it is partially my fault. I just wanted to give other consumers like me, who do not read every aspect of the websites they order from, the "heads up" so they know what they can expect as far as shipping time. As soon as I receive the merchandise, I can review the quality. Hopefully I'll receive my summer dresses before winter! :)

The paint has smeared all over and tissue paper was sticking to it. I will not order anything else. I paid $45 with shipping. This dress even if it was not damaged is not worth more than $12.

VI used to have a good experience with website a year ago - items were good and delivery took not more than two weeks - although it is a long wait - this is what they initially promised so I can't complain. But something happened - suddenly items I ordered took more than three weeks to arrive, sizes way smaller than standard. Poor quality, but the final Fri was when items were sent to the wrong address. It was dealt with VERY poorly. String of email sent back and forth until I managed to convince zulily that sending items to the wrong address is THEIR fault. Very disappointed! Not using them again and certainly not recommending!

It looks so pretty in the photos, until you receive it. All cheap junk, worth maybe 1/4 of what you paid for it. So disappointing. I have given them several chances as I know some people really like this  site. Well I've returned three things, got a store credit and tried one last time. CRAP. All cheap, flimsy, poorly made, ugly in real life. Sorry Zulilly, improve your merchandise because i am done! Never again.

VI don't like how after reading how the site works, and it stating that the sales run for approximately 72 hours, how a week later my items still aren't being shipped to Zulily. They're no longer available on the site, so the sale is obviously over, no one can make anymore orders, yet the items still aren't being shipped, and according to their site won't be for another week! Then according to their site, it takes them a week to get the times, then 'several days' (a week) until I get it. That's about a month total until you get something you ordered! A little much I think...I won't shop here again.

VI uses website a lot.  I was like to give him the benefit of the doubt.  I do agree that their customer service is outstanding.  The quality of their products however can be poor.  There is no ability for repeat customers to rate the companies that are selling stuff on this website.  My experience with some of the benders has been extremely poor quality merchandise.  The known benders that to put stuff on this website have sold me outstanding products and a very decent price that I could not find anyone else.  I caution anyone against buying stuff from this website if they do not know the brand.  \u000aI bought books from this website that were missed printed and us not able to be given as gets or even read properly by myself.

VFirst of all, do be prepared to wait. Zulily orders from the manufacturers first, and then ships it to you. I waited about a week and half for my item which was fine, since I expected to. However, they sent me the WRONG item. I emailed them and they emailed be back quickly. They said that they no longer carry the correct item so they gave me a full refund and had me keep the item I received. They also gave me $10 of store credit. All fine and dandy except I was really looking forward to getting this item especially at the great price of 60% off. Now, I can not find it anywhere for anywhere near the same price. Will I order from again? Probably not.

VAfter reading a few reviews I feel I've been scammed by Zulily and that what I initially thought my mistake was theirs (but a mistake?  hmm)...and more common than I might think.\u000a\u000aI've had 2 orders where there were duplicate items and they were some of the most recent.  The first I thought my fault and let it go.  The 2nd time there were not only duplicates but these were things in my basket that I had left there deciding not to order at the time. I DID NOT send the orders through and one of the items there was a duplicate.  This order was about $100 worth and I didn't even know it was coming until they announced the delivery in an email.  I checked their update emails when they came and also my orders on the site and both orders had been put in that way making it look like my mistake.  I wrote them about it but all I received was a change-of-password email, nothing about what happened like someone must have hacked my account.  If so, why would they have stuff I'd put in the basket sent to me??  I was already receiving a few things in banged up boxes and a few scuffed that I kept anyway because they've stated no returns... so I wasn't ordering anything so easily anymore.   Then this started happening.\u000a\u000aI'm closing my account.  After dozens of orders and now with this type of scam I'm through.  I feel they should be investigated at this point.

VI have made, roughly, 10 or so orders from this site (as of recent)--probably more; as I am in the process of stocking my "hope chest" for my baby-having days, and hoping to be a stay-at-home mamma--on less-to-none of my current income.  So, I have been "investing" where my hopes lie....  \u000a\u000aFrom, I thought, my newly discovered excitement, "Zulily:" I have had two or three of those orders "doubled," as in - sent AND BILLED x2 for ONE order made; I did receive all multiple shipments; but obviously, I have no need for two of the EXACT same item, same size, in entire order quantities.  Oh, wait, what's that?---I CAN'T RETURN ANY OF IT.  Zulily says I am S.O.L.  They don't accept returns, for any reasons.  Oh, also, the items I did order, they're direct from CHINA, in cheap clear wrap (really: no-tag items), almost all were made of SUPER cheap material, like dollar-store quality, threads loose and all over the place, untrimmed, barely look like they'll make it through a couple wash-cycles.  Sizes WAY off.  Tried to order a few things in sizes 2 years apart, hoping for matching sibling outfits down the road. Sizes NO where close to relevant....Not pleased.  Wish I hadn't been so excited over the seemingly "good" deals.  Oh, what's that you say Zulily?---Dress is $70 retail...Not quite.  Maybe $5, full-price, at Wal-Mart...or on clearance for $1.20.  Thanks for stealing my $20 for a $2 dress, etc., times way too many.  Oh, also, don't count on the refer-a-friend for "$10 credit" to your account (upon their purchase)...it never comes.  Of course, there's no tracking, no customer service, and no returns, or credit back.

VI received an email about items for sale and wanted to try it out. The items were cute for kids and the maxi dresses were priced right. Then I saw Gucci sunglasses and decided to buy them. Unfortunately, since this was my first time ever using the site, I was not aware of the actual shipping process which could take 10-17 days before the item EVER leaves their warehouse, & then of course the slowest method of delivery ever! So long story short, I was buying the maxi dresses for my vacation scheduled 3 weeks after my purchase and had to cancel those dresses since they wouldn't come in time for my trip. I decided to take my chances on the other items and wait. Some of the items came in 3 weeks.  Though the glasses were a Valentines gift, I finally received a yesterday (March 2nd). I would say if you need to order things and its not time sensitive, you can shop here. But considering today's technology & sites like amazon offering next day delivery, it's not worth the wait for me. I will probably not use the site again unless the sipping process improves. Also, there is confusion as to what is being charged once items are cancelled. I couldn't figure out what I would be charged for. It also took forever for the charges to hot my account.

It was a knitted scarf that was already unravelling and had a chemical odor.  Zulilly did refund the money and gave me an additional credit.

Second, an item was received damaged, a hole in the dress where the tag was sewn in and a ripped seam, no returns or replacements from this site. Third, quality is below average on some clothing items and since there is no returns you are S.O.L. One good thing if the item is damaged they will credit your card and issue a "store credit". Also, never order something that you need immediately, there is no express shipping and it takes about 3 weeks to receive an order.

I've tried three orders - and all have had difficulties with the products. One was mislabeled as being a current season product - but when it came it was last season's (and was being sold at the same price by the designer's webpage). Another was the wrong size - came as an infant size when a 12-18month was ordered. Another came missing several buttons. The last problem is obviously the manufacturers fault........but again, I've never had this difficulty with RueLaLa or other discounting webpages.

However, the person who said order things a size bigger because your children will have grown by the time you get it was spot on. Seriously, if they want to stay in business they've got to get it together to use another mail service. Expect to wait as much as five weeks for something to get to you. Cute stuff, expensive brands pretty cheap, but I just can't wait for stuff like this. I'd rather pay more and get it sooner. The shipping and handling charge is as much for other companies that ship within a day or two, and you get it within a week, such as Crazy 8.

My second order was a pair of boots: I was so excited to have found this particular pair and would be able to wear them for winter (and let me just say my winter is literally for a split second, if at all,) so I ordered them at the beginning of December and almost 2 months later they arrived!!! Needless to say, they will sit in my closet until next year since our winter is over and we're back in the 80's!  When shipping says 10 -14 business days you should actually double or triple that time; at least that way when it comes sooner you will be surprised.

The order does take a long time before your receive them; approximately 1 month.\u000a2.  From our experience, we ordered an item and can be cancelled at anytime.  In this case, of the 15 items we ordered, they decided to cancel two items. One we got notified and the other we did not know about.  We are still waiting for our refund.\u000a3.  We received two of the same item even though we only ordered one and we did not received one item that was ordered.  This a was a bit irritating!  Not worth shipped back since it will cost us money to ship back to them.\u000a\u000aIn summary, it can be a crap shoot ordering stuff from Zulily.  So if your the gambling type, go ahead and order from them and hopefully, you get what you order; you just have to wait a while to get it.  I don't think that I will gamble again with these guys!!!

It does take forever to get the cloths but knowing this I always order a size up. This last time I ordered 6 Duck Duck Goose outfits.... every single one of them came FALLING APART. Litterally falling apart at the seems. The outfits I ordered were panks, long sleeves onsies with attached tutus and matching headbands. The headbands are crap but thats not why I ordered the outfits. They looked like cute play outfits for my daughter... play outfits forget it! She can't even move in them without something ripping! And no they are not to small they are just that poorly made. I got them each for $10 they normally go for $20 who in their right mind would pay $20 for this craptastic outfits is beyond me. And guess what NO RETURNS! So I am stuck with them. I can't seem to find Duck Duck Goose's website so Zulilly take the fall here.

VBasically I'd call this website concept a big fail.  My understanding is the site is merely a portal to ordering from small designer and boutiques.  They carry nothing in stock, and place your order with others ordered during the same "sale".  Once they receive your order, they ship all or part of your order to you.  I do say they have some pretty good deals.  The real issue is waiting up to two months to receive a completed order....if you ever receive it.  \u000a\u000aI've place three orders.  The first arrived within about 3 weeks.  three items in the order and it was right at the end of the "sale".  FYI....i did find one of the items I ordered elsewhere for about half the price.  \u000a\u000aThe second order was placed a month ago, and it *still* not delivered.  several items have been received, some are in transit with a trackable id, and some HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN SENT YET.  \u000a\u000aThe last order was place the day after the second order and nothing has been received.  And nothing from Zulily regarding the status.\u000a\u000athe items that I have received are in poor to decent shape.  but everything was jammed in to a shipping bag.  without even a shipping receipt.  Many items have loose threads CLEARLY visible....one came with two missing buttons.  None of this should have been sent to me and there is a no returns policy.  I emailed about the quality and the CS response was basically they take no responsibility for the quality of items they "distribute".\u000a\u000aWhy the concept fails?  Well, this is a Mums and young child focused site.  What pregnany gal wants to wait 2 months before receiving their maternity clothes?  we want....we NEED a quicker turn-around.  Same with baby clothing.  Fortunately, I am shopping for the yet-to-be-born, and I have three months still....so baby is OK.  But if you are shopping for a child of the "already-born" variety.....find another site.  The child will be out of that size before the items arrive.\u000a\u000aThe quality is questionable.  The baby clothing material is all good....but I stayed with cotton, organic cotton, and natural fiber knits.  don't dress your child in synthetics....and check before you buy.  One of the maternity items i ordered is a joke $65 for a see-through-quality acetate (the description said natural fiber blend, I suppose the stitching is cotton?)  Its unacceptable.  What really gets me is those loose threads.  Who SELLS such crap?  Why this fails?.....the website really is nothing but a portal and does not even have internal Quality Assurance of the merchandise they market. \u000a\u000aWill not shop here again.  quality and time are big factors to me.  No sale is worth a sacrifice in either!!!!

VNO RETURNS.  Only order DEFINITE know you want items & items you know you want 2 months from now.  No joke your average wait time on products is MINIMUM 1 month!!  I don't mind ordering in advance but really think about is it worth the price & wait.  The customer service I think has improved a little.  The other stinky thing is you think you ordered and item and 1 month later they finally tell you, Sorry we ran out of the item.  Wow, a little more notice would be great.  So that's why I recommend 2 months advance time frame, so if a month goes by & you don't get the item you still have some time to find it somewhere else.

My latest order was the last straw: the two clothing items I ordered were at least four sizes smaller than the marked/stated size. With their across the board no return policy, I don't have much hope of recovering the $49 I paid. Most of the stuff is on here FOR A REASON - it would be unsellable in a retail store.

VI have been purchasing items from Zulily for a few months now.  Despite very long shipping times, I was please with what I received.  However, I found out today that a SKIP HOP diaper bag that I ordered three weeks ago (progressed from "confirmed" to "in transit to zulily") is now CANCELLED!  I will not be getting the bag that I ordered while hundreds of other orders for the same bag is being filled.  The customer service rep (who was very nice) explained that the vendor may say they have 1000 items to send, but may only send like 980 or may send some damaged.  I think this reflects VERY POORLY on both ZULILY and SKIP HOP and I will think twice before I order from them again.  Please keep in mind that "confirmed" and "in transit to zulily" DO NOT MEAN ANYTHING and you're order is not complete until you have a tracking number.

VPurchased three items on July 7th,  and today, July 30th, still have not received them!  When they say order processed in 7-14 business days, make sure you focus on the words "processed" and "business days"!  I have e-mailed the company twice, and in both replies from them, they simply explain how their business works which basically is "we'll mail you your order when we get it from the vendor and then after we spend a week or two, after receiving it, getting it mailed out to you".  My order started as a UPS delivery and ended up as a postal delivery - although since I haven't received it yet, I am not sure how it actually will arrive.  On top of all of this and the fact that they took my money when weeks ago, the items I ordered are not returnable!  This is my second experience with Zulily and most likely my last.  They claim to be unique and to offer such fabulous deals which translates into, I think, "we are worth the time and trouble".  No, they actually aren't!  DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY IF YOU WANT TO RECEIVE IT IN LESS THAN THREE WEEKS (i.e., 15 BUSINESS DAYS!).

There were threads hanging out, the ribbon was twisted, the elastic was twisted, it was like these were the reject clothing. I feel this site find clothes that didn't meet the manufacture's requirements, so they take the "bad" clothes and sell them to us at "dirt cheap" prices. If you don't mind reject clothing, then shop here.  My daughter LOVED the clothes, so we kept them (b/c she's spoiled) but I won't buy again.

VI have placed many orders through Zulily and have a mixed opinion of them. \u000aPros:\u000a-They have a lot of super-cute clothing items at amazing prices (sometimes, see cons)\u000a-Their customer service really can't be beat. Every time I've received a wrong/damaged/defective item they return the money and give me a $10-$20 credit depending on the customer service agent I get and how many items I'm complaining about. I've had them, on one occasion, refund me for things that were just fine as an "I'm sorry" gesture. I've also had them re-send out one item that they did have in stock currently instead of refunding the money and I received it only a few days later instead of the standard 3 week wait. \u000a-The refer a friend money is a nice little bonus. \u000a-I have gotten many, many items that I've been over-the-moon happy with. \u000a-Though I have had a LOT of messed up merchandise sent to me, I have eventually ended up with stuff I like a lot and CAN use... In fact, I only continue to order through Zulily because they do the $10 credit as an "I'm sorry" gesture. I've come out far ahead in the end so long as I was willing to follow up with the e-mails complaining about things that were actually defective. \u000a\u000aCons:\u000a-I have received a LOT of items that have either worn out terribly, come with holes in seams, are the wrong item, are the wrong size, are not as described, or are very clearly merchandise that didn't make the cut from quality control by the maker. As in, I've had about 15 items that I've had to complain about BUT all but one were returned in full, given a $10 credit for, and I was able to keep the merchandise. Some of the merchandise was usable, but wrong or damaged. For instance, I have a pair of pants that came with a hole in the seam. I was refunded for it, but the hole is in an area that, though the material is not one that I can just repair it, you cannot see the hole and it is stable. So I can still wear the pants. Or, I was sent the wrong color dress so it was refunded but I was able to keep and wear another, pretty dress. \u000a-Shipping takes a long time, but they say that flat out. I dislike how long it takes but when I make purchases I keep that in mind. If I want a bathing suit for my daughter, for example, I assume I won't have it for a couple months so I would only consider purchasing that season's bathing suit no later than April and if she is getting ready to outgrow a size, I size up. \u000a-Some "great prices" aren't so great. I know for a fact the B. (Battel) toys are FAR cheaper at Target. I found a couple other outfits that were cheaper on Amazon and they sell Alva diapers that have been rebranded (which is allowed by Alva) and sold at much higher prices than Alva's alone. Alvababy.com sells their diapers for about $5 a piece with an insert (cloth diapers) and always has completely free shipping. Zulily will sell them for $10-25 under different names and charges shipping...\u000a-Which brings me to another con: shipping prices. No matter what you buy, the shipping is $7.99. That's not a big deal if you spend a ton of money on there but it's ridiculously irritating and limiting if, say, I wanted to buy some cut hairclips for a couple bucks. Well, I can't, because I refuse to pay $8 in shipping charges for something that could be tossed in an envelop and mailed with a regular stamp. \u000a-Lastly, I'm fairly certain that everything they sell is not the same quality you can find in the stores. Sometimes seams are off a little, sometimes there's something uneven or unbalanced or wrong. Their descriptions could be much more informative and accurate on the website and you don't always know the brand of what you're buying. \u000a\u000aSo I guess my overall impression is that they are not scammers, but they make money by selling subpar merchandise and hoping no one complains about it. But they do stand by the merchandise and refund it when you bring up the problems.

I was almost 100% satisfied with the quality of the product. with one exception, a paid of boots I got for here were really not a good fit, but I didnt complain too much for $12. kids shoes are so expensive for the amount of time that they wear them.\u000aI do not like that it takes way too long to get the items and that there are no returns. when you order shoes it is hard to know they will fit. it would be good if they could accept returns on specific items.

I ordered 3 vests and those were fine but other clothing are the problem.  I am expecting more shipment but I don't have much hope that they will be any better than what I have received so far.  I will now have to go into the store and buy Christmas gifts for my family and friends.  I would like to cancel the orders that have not been shipped yet but seems it's impossible.

VI have not experienced the same quality issues that others have mentioned. The product I have received has always been of a high quality and standard. My biggest gripe with the site is the length of time they take to take my payment. I placed an order on 10/12 and only today, 10/29, has the amount been taken from my account. It's just really annoying. Because of this, I'll probably not used he site anymore.

VI've spent thousands of dollars here. Sometimes I get lucky with some pretty things, other times I get some cheaply made things. Zulily is rich with the help of suckers like me. I absolutely love the things that I can't find anywhere like certain items for my children. But the items for adults are usually blah. Cheap and thin & well ugly. They look fantastic in photos but in person, they are awful. There are items on zulily that are not original on zulily. Don't let them fool you. I google brands and prices and find them almost 20% cheaper and with coupon codes elsewhere. Make sure you always look elsewhere first. Maybe, zulily will catch the hint and place an appropriate sale price on their items if they want to claim its a real discount. What I really hate is that they are giving me less of an incentive to shop there. And, I was an ideal customer. Shops on the site everyday, spends hundreds at a time. Where's my incentive? Do I get a coupon code? Nope!  Do I get free shopping for more than just 1 or 2 days? Nope! I'd like some credit for shopping so much and spending so much money! Free shipping for the remainder of the day isn't going to cut it. After all, if I just purchased some items, I'm done shopping for the day so what good is the free shipping for the remainder of the day doing??. Like I said. Google items & coupon codes before you shop on zulily because most likely you will find the same item on sale elsewhere and for a significantly cheaper price! Sorry, zulily. You need to compete with pricing now!! It's one of those kinds of decades!!

VI placed my first order with Zulily last month. Upon placing my order, I then realized that it would take 12-16 business days for my items to even ship from their warehouse. That's disappointing. I ordered 3 pairs of maternity capris and one pair of maternity jeans. I followed their size chart & when I finally received the first pair of capris, they were already too small. I'm was only 3 months pregnant at the time & they were already too tight. Their sizing charts are not accurate for me. Their maternity tops will fit me just fine. In the future, I will not purchase maternity bottoms from them. When I discovered that the other 3 maternity bottoms I ordered will not fit, I called Zulily and spoke with a rep, who advised me that I was able to cancel the remaining capris and jeans and not be charged for them. Later that night, I got an email from Zulily saying that my remaining items shipped including the pants I cancelled earlier. I sent an email regarding this to customer service & got a phone call the very next day from a helpful rep. Though he couldn't obviously stop the items from arriving to my home, he was kind enough to refund the charges for the capris and jeans and told me to keep them if they fit fine and call for a return label if they do not. Zulily was kind enough to help me with my order and though I don't like the long wait for my items, somewhat inaccurate sizing charts & receiving my order in multiple shipments, I will still shop with them again. They have great deals for sure.

VIt's a good site with a lot of excellent deals...but I suggest you think long and hard before hitting that purchase button.  \u000a\u000aI have bought far too many things from this site, and have several issues with it.\u000a\u000a1.  almost all - if not all - of the items are non-returnable/non-exchangable\u000a2.  don't buy it if you need it in a hurry, because I just received an item I'd purchased well over a month ago.  This has happened before.\u000a3.  sometimes, the items are a tad...off?  I bought a shirt for my son and a spring windbreaker for my daughter, and both were flawed.  The applique on my son's shirt was not positioned correctly, as the embroidery over top of it was off and the writing on the shirt was partially covered, and my daughter's jacket wasn't sewn correctly over the velcro tabs.  As a result...\u000a4.  I'm thinking sometimes companies sell their slightly flawed items through Zulily, hoping people won't notice or care because the discount is so high.\u000a\u000aOut of every ten items I've purchased (told you I bought a lot), one is a stinker and waste of money.  Yes, I could contact them and complain, but if it's non-refundable and you know it up front, I'm not expecting much love in return.  Literally and figuratively!\u000a\u000aI did contact customer service once regarding an item I'd purchased and they were prompt in response.  So, I can't complain about that.

VI have grown to love Zulily over the years. The first time I made a purchase, I was disappointed with the length of time it took to receive the item. However, Zulily does explain why their items take longer to ship and now I order with this understanding in mind, knowing it will take some time to receive an item. I have made hundreds of purchases through the site and I am satisfied with my purchases about 90% of the time. There have been items that I have received that seem to have defects from the manufacturer....material sewn crooked, mislabel of the size, etc. Every time I have felt I like I did not receive what I paid for, I email Zulily and their customer service is exceptional. They do not accept returns, but I feel they are very fair in how they deal with a situation like this. I have either a received a full refund or a store credit or even both for items that were not up to par. Because I know this and thus far have had good experience with how they handle these situations, I continue to shop with them. As long as I feel like I am getting what I pay for and that Zulily will back this up, I will be a loyal customer :)

VI ordered 2 pairs of boots. The shipping turn around does take some time, but it was clearly stated when I made my purchase. They even came a couple days earlier than originally expected. I'm sure some of the bad reviews are justified, but I had to share my expierence with the company as I did encounter an issue. Both pairs of boots were manufactured by the same company and I ordered a 5 1/2 for both. However, only one of the pairs fit, and the other which was labeled everywhere a 5 1/2; was a size and a half too big. A friend tried them on who is a size 7 and they fit perfect. I called customer service and they couldn't of done a better job to keep me a satisfied customer. They not only refunded my account with a store credit, they let me keep the boots to pass along to my girlfriend. A+++ for customer service! I've ordered on similar sites (i.e., Nomorerack) and their customer service department was terrible! I now know where to order items for the holidays if I am looking for a good deal. Although, I will be aware of the items that I do purchase. Happy Shopping! Hope this helps some...

VMy review is mainly about their customer service. We moved recently and I mistakenly didn't change my address when placing an order and my packages were sent to my old house and subsequently, refused. Zulily customer service changed my address for me and immediately had the packages re-sent to me. Unfortunately, one of the outfits I ordered appeared to have mildew or some other stain on it, so I called customer service. They could not have been more helpful! Not only did I receive a full refund for the outfit (because they showed no others in stock) but I also received a $10.00 credit because it didn't work out. The entire transaction took maybe 5 minutes and I couldn't have been happier. Very please to see good customer service!!

VI do buy a good amount of stuff from Zulily.  There are good points and not so good ones.  I am usually satisfied with the stuff I buy.  I have, however, ordered a couple items and then a few days later have received a notice that I will not get an item.  I have also received damaged items.  Zulily has always refunded the cost and sometimes also given me a $10 credit.  Some of the prices are so low, I just cannot order them.  My bigger complaint is the shipping time.  It does take a longer than average time to get purchases.  You really can't depend on getting your stuff by holidays or birthdays or events like that.  If I buy from them, it is usually for stuff I am not in a hurry for.

VThere are a lot of really cute items on the site.  The quality varies depending on the brand, but most of the brands I have tried have been good or average.  A few were low quality.  There's a few that have very nice quality clothes, but the quality is not what I would have considered high end.  The quality seems comparable to items I've bought at Kohl's, Macy's, T.J.Maxx or Marshall's, but usually not as good as a high-quality store like Gymboree.  I've googled some of the brands and most don't usually sell for much more than the prices on Zulily.  For some of the toys, the prices were better on Zulily than elsewhere, but I've gotten a couple of damaged toys.  Their customer service has been good to me.  They actually refunded me the price of all of the damaged items I've received.  I would never recommend buying a gift from this site because it does take a while for shipping and when you order something, there's no guarantee you'll get it.  I've ordered a few items that got "canceled".  They say that they bulk order the merchandise from vendors and sometimes the vendors don't send enough items to fill all of the orders.  I don't understand how a company that seems to be doing well and is well-known can't contact a vendor who frequently sells items on their site and request more of an item so they aren't disappointing customers.  Many of the brands I googled don't seem to be sold at many places, so I would think they make a lot of money off of Zulily and should want to meet their customer's demands.  Usually the prices aren't really a steal; clearance prices elsewhere are usually more of a deal.  It's a fun site to shop because of the way they display the clothing and many of the items are cute and unique.  If you order from the site, buy for yourself or your own children and just keep in mind that you'll almost definitely wait almost a month or more to receive the item and there's a real possibility your item(s) will be canceled.  Also remember when shopping that they put a hold on your credit card for about three days and then take it off.  A month or so later when they item actually ships, the amount is then charged.  It is hard to keep tract of and I can see how it can lead to trouble.  Overall, I've bought a lot of clothing, toys and maternity/baby items from Zulily that I loved and I do really like the site.  It's just a site that you have judge in its own category instead of like a regular store.

VI ordered during the labor day weekend (Aug.30-Sept.2). With paying shipping for one order, I got free shipping for the rest of the weekend which was great! I know that it does take some time for them to ship so I kep close tabs on the shipping date that they publish after I submitted my order. Since some of the items I ordered I need to receive prior to 9/20, I cancelled those that were published with Sept 17 shipping date. Costumer service was great! They cancelled those items I requested right away.\u000a\u000aFor those items that were published as shipped, I received them in 2 different packaging on 9/10 which was awesome! The items were good quality (1 swimming inflatable toy, 2 shirts, a cheerleader Adidas costume and Hello Kitty Crocs for my toddler and 1 pair of shoes for me). The only ones I'm waiting for are the Birks sandals for me and my husband which was not time sensitive for me so I was ok with not receiving those right away.\u000a\u000aI would definitely buy again in Zulily. Just take note that if you have time sensitive items, keep track and cancel if you think those items won't arrive on time. Customer service was pretty honest when I asked them on the items I wanted to cancel since I wasn't sure if I'll get it prior to 9/20.

VI have placed 7 separate orders with zulilly and am very satisfied. Yes, the shipping takes forever but they don't hide that fact from you, it's on the site.  I ordered some croc flip-flops with pink accents and was notified that they were no longer available and I was being upgraded to a 2013 style. When they arrived, they were all black and grey, way too masculine, I called and complained and was refunded the amount of the shoes plus $10 and told to keep or donate the shoes! As for the complaints about poor quality, I am just picky about what I order and stick to name brands I recognize! I did order some cheap jumpers for my daughter but they were $8 for a complete outfit and I really only need them to last a few months! Totally worth it!

VI recently ordered over 150 items from zulily. The items are shipped when they are received from the source. Initially, I waited about 8 days for my first shipment. This shipment was a combination of available items from different orders. After that, a lot of my items have been shipped. \u000aThe only problem I have is with the bank balance. It would seem that I am billed from the time I place the order. Then my balance keeps fluctuating each time items are shipped to me. \u000aI have not received all my items so I am not sure if my balance will be fixed after that. I have contacted zulily to ask whether I am being billed twice. I am awaiting a response.\u000aThe items I have received so far are exactly as they were presented on the site. I have no complaints and the quality is excellent. \u000aOh one more thing, I have been shopping around and found some of the same items , same colour, material, brand, from Zulily on other sites for half the price. So shop around before making a final purchase since they are not quite the cheapest for all items. \u000aOverall, great site for online shopping. I hate that sooo many cute things have to be added each day. Happy shopping.

Shipping takes awhile but they do explain that the merchandise comes from somewhere else, then Zulily ships it to you. \u000a\u000aI am 100% satisfied with my dress. The size is accurate, the fabric is very comfy and a nice quality for such a low price. The dress looks nice in the picture but I wasn't sure what it would actually look like. I am very pleased with the quality and fit. \u000a\u000aI don't agree with their no returns policy and the shipping is extremely slow, so they should change those two things if they want to stay competitive with other retailers, but I would order again as long as I'm not in a hurry for it.

VI have made MANY purchases, and will continue to do so.  The website is upfront about return policy (it IS an outlet site after all).  It explains that it initially puts a hold on your credit card when you place the order, but the charge comes off until each item ships.  Every manufacturer provides a size chart- if unsure, DON'T buy.  Shipping- most items take 12-16 BUSINESS days (about 3 weeks).  No surprise, it's an outlet site with cheap/free shipping.  I keep seeing complaints over issues which Zulily is upfront.  ?

VFirst- this site has some really good deals, but you have to read the "rules". It takes awhile for them to fulfill orders as noted on their site because they purchase as a group order after the sale is over- they then receive the items and distribute them with the rest of your order. It would be like you buying from 5 different companies, receiving the items from each company and then remailing them out to a family member.  \u000a\u000aMost of my orders arrive in about one month. If it's not a GREAT deal- I don't buy from Zulily. I NEVER order shoes for my kids as there are no returns- unless I know the brand well and their size in that brand.\u000a\u000aI recently had a defective snap on the cutest snowpants ever. I was a little nervous because they don't offer returns.  However, I took a photo and emailed customer service. They responded VERY quickly and apologized, gave me a refund AND a $10 credit towards a future purchase. I was also able to keep the pants as they are not able to exchange (again- they order in a way that is similar to samples). \u000a\u000aCustomer service is A+, timing is slow, but if you can wait patiently there are some really good deals to be had.  If it's not more than a 30% discount- don't bother.  But-I have bought Keens at over 50% off, which is unheard of.

VI have been ordering items from Zulily for years.  For the most part, I have not been disappointed.  For deals to be as good as theirs, it is important to read all the info on the site.  Most items are sent to them from wherever..., then sent to the purchaser.  Most items are non-returnable.  Read before you buy, know the product and plan ahead and these are great bargains.

VI just recently received my very first order from Zulily, and it did take almost two weeks.  However, this I understood from checking my online account everyday and reading "Ships 12-16 Days" or something similar to that under every one of my orders. I just found SiteJabber about an hour ago and was looking for reviews about another site (which to my disappointed received negative reviews).  I'm very into online shopping and was using SiteJabber to find some great sites to shop.  And then it hit me to check Zulily.com, because my first order was delivered in the time THEY said it would and I had just made some more orders yesterday because I'd fallen in love with my purchases.  I was curious to see what customers would say, and since I didn't expect to see so many bad reviews, I was definitely surprised.  \u000a\u000aBut I can't really say a whole lot since my very first order was the only order that recently arrived.  I'm still waiting on the other orders I made a little after that first order.  So I haven't had to call or go through any of the previously mentioned bad customer service. Also, people should definitely be aware of the No Returns label. I literally just picked a size I thought would fit and crossed my fingers (I went with my gut basically).  Luckily, the coat and black cardigan I ordered both fit and I LOVE them. \u000a\u000aI will probably add another comment should I receive my next packages or if I get bad luck and have to give a negative review.  Hoping for the former!

VZulily is great for deals on products that you already know a little bit about, because not all of the brands represented are of good quality.  The site clearly states there are no returns, which is the reason for the drop in cost to the items in the first place. If I don't trust whether something will fit, I google the brand name and pay more to purchase it from somewhere else with a return policy. Simple. I've never had an issue with shipping or with with a damaged item. I've had a cancelled product, but was notified, had my money refunded and given an extra shopping bonus.

VI have placed maybe a dozen orders and within those orders have been at least 50 items. I have had only one item get cancelled and they notified me right away. I have had quality issues with a couple items from unknown manufacturers of women's clothing. Lesson learned, I will only buy from known brands in the future. My orders never take more than a few weeks to arrive. I think the site is very clear about how this process works. I think consumers have to do their homework. Not everything on Zulily is an amazing deal. I like it, it works for me and I do not work for them. LOL

VI can't say that I have had a bad experience with Zulily and I have ordered repeatedly from them many times. I have gotten very good deals, and a few unique things that you just can't find in any old chain store. The quality goods i have ordered have always been very nice. But with that being said, I will advise you if you are thinking of ordering something from Zulily, make sure you don't need it right away...as in if it's a Christmas present or you need it for an event order it well in advance, as the shipping process is VERY slow. (It does state on the website that it ships within 14 BUSINESS days - as in almost 3 weeks.) Also, I've noticed that most items seem to be un-returnable. It also states this on the website. So, I would say in my experience,if you don't need something right away and you are patient you can get some really great deals through Zulily.

VI have received zulily emails for quite some time now but never made a purchase until May 29.  I shop mostly online, so I am always careful to read the return policies before placing the order.  I understand zulily's no refund policy considering they are not the vendor and only shop the best deals for you.  I needed the item for June 24th.  The website stated 12-16 days shipping time which would get the item here just in time.  So I placed the order.  Then I started reading reviews - backwards process, I know -  and begain to panic after reading all the negative reviews.  The sale of my item ended June 1st.  I received my item June 13th. I should note that i live on the east coast and zulily is west coast.   No hang ups with ups mail innovations or my post office and the item is just lovely.  I can see however where some items might time, etc since zulily relies on the vendor to ship them the item before they ship to the buyer.  I will order from zulily again - probably not for last minute items again

VI've been shopping with Zulily since April of 2011, and from that time have had 12 orders either completed or processing (I just placed another order last week.)\u000aMost everything I've purchased from them, understanding that the process is much like drop-ship, has been either excellent or satisfactory. Knowing that it might take a while to get the goods, or that the order could be cancelled, I have never ordered anything I need right now.\u000aI said most. I've had two exceptions to this, and I'll explain how I approached them and how they responded.\u000aA couple months ago I ordered some blow-out sandals for my daughter, which were advertized as sueded leather. That's getting harder to find, and I don't dig pleather. It doesn't hold up, and I resent paying leather price for plastic shoes...\u000aThese were VERY inexpensive, and exactly the style I knew my daughter would love. Ordered.Turn-around was within a month or ordering, might have been the third week after placing my order. That was fine...but upon inspection I realized that the description was wrong. Synthetic, not leather. DAMN. Well, she loved them and even with shipping, came out cheaper than what I could have found locally, so I kept them.\u000aMost recent order that has shipped - ordered an unusual item not found in the States, one of the funky Eco-Euro brands, and something I'd wanted for my kid but hadn't quite come to appreciate the price, even at a discount. Finally, when it was the only size left, and the only one left, I ordered it.\u000aThat came rather quickly - I think it was within two weeks of ordering, though part of the order is still pending...(that's alright - it's for winter.)\u000aThe item seemed fine, looked it over and decided to launder it according to the label. Solid, faded black garment. After washing, a splotchy faded black and light brown garment. NO NO NO NO. Gentle soap, careful cycle...no bleach...this isn't right. \u000aI contacted them immediately, and without anger but concisely explained to them what had happened to this item, and in addition about the leather sandals that weren't.\u000aI really didn't expect much since this was a final sale, but I left it open, "Please advise."\u000aI received a response within 24 hours, full of apologies, and although they would not authorize a return, told me to keep the damaged item (I'd explained I would try to redye it) or donate it, credited my card back for the purchase amount (I had other things shipping) and gave me a store credit for the sandals my daughter is wearing...and another $10.00 merchandise credit for my troubles.\u000a\u000aSo, yes, I would prefer that the order had gone smoothly, but either my way of communicating was effective, I lucked out and got the right CS agent, or they've had enough complaints that the company is starting to modify how it handles merchandise issues.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI will continue to order from them, but as I mentioned above, also with a caveat - nothing I need now, and not for anything I can't live without.

VZULILLY IS GREAT QUALITY AT A GREAT PRICE BUT NOT INSTANT GRATIFICATION!  I have bought several items from Zuliliy and have been happy with every one.  I understand that it takes awhile for my items to ship so I NEVER purchase anything I need quickly.  I have been very pleased with the quality - my only complaint is that most of the items on the site are not my taste (too overloaded with embellishments) and it takes a while to go through the site to find items that I really love....but when I do - it is wonderful.

I had 1 pair of sandals come in the wrong color and when I emailed them they got back to me the same day and told me that the color that I had ordered was out of stock and to just keep the pair that I got and they would credit my card for the shoes and give me a $10 store credit for the mix up. Already have used the store credit for another order. I understand the shipping takes a little longer just because they order in bulk from the places that supply the items once they have all of the orders in....I would not order anything from here that I just had to have by a certain date.  =)

But given I know that I just order stuff in advance (I am normally ordering a future size anyhoo).  I haven't had one bad item (quality) at all in children's clothing and the one women's item I received that was really oddly sized they did accept back with a full refund despite their policy.  (I sent them a picture showing that the arms were literally a foot too long).  \u000a\u000aFor shoes and children's clothing I use this site almost exclusively.  Occasionally I order housewares or women's items.  I'd say that 99% of the time I'm thrilled with the items I receive, but then again I look at brand names carefully so I don't get an off item.

For\u000aexample.I ordered a baby outfit in size 0-3 months but was sent a 12 month size.\u000aZulily credited my credit card for the amount and gave me a 10.00 credit. also told me to keep the 12 month outfit. All the clothes I ordered, and I have been using Zulily for 3 years have been high quality..I will always recommend this site to my friends.The site explains their  shipping process and lets you know that you will not have quick shipping,

VI am totally bewildered by the one star ratings for Zulily! My experience has been the best--great clothing, books and toys for our grandchildren and superb household items and affordable clothing for their parents.None of the items which I received could be considered of inferior quality.Much of my shopping for Christmas was done at what I consider a fabulous site. Furthermore, I have found the customer service team to be responsive and pleasant. Zulily will always be the first place I go to shop!

I had bought 2 really cute coats for my little girls but no sooner did they wear them buttons were falling off. The coats were poorly made. I come browse but I wont buy anything because I'm gonna hate if I get the same quality. Good luck buyers.

Vi find it odd to see so many negative comments on zulily, any time i had a problem, they take care of it, I had a shirt that came with a hole in it and they gave me my money back and I got to keep the shirt, just fix the hole. And yes their ship times are slow but it CLEARLY noted on the site.  I have found the customer service to be Amazing. As for quality of items, it sometimes is a crap shoot, but again I found the customer service reps empowered and ready to help out, even if it is store credit.  I did order a shirt and wonder why it fit so small, but my bad I didnt look at he size chart.  You really have to read over the whole description and site rules and stuff before you can get too upset.

VShipping does take a while, but this is clearly stated before you place your order. I have loved everything I have ordered, and I have ordered many items over the past several months. All of my favorites are from zulily. They also tell me when my order is being shipped to zulily and when it has left for my home delivery and provide a tracking number. I have had no problems, so I have not had to contact customer service, so I cannot speak to that.

VI am  very familiar with Zulily and find it unfortunate that so many shoppers had a less than wonderful experience with the website, but after reading several reviews I was compelled to write my own. Zulily is a wonderful site that sells great merchandise at a sharply discounted rate. I believe that there are purchasers who bought garments or other merchandise that was damaged. This, however, is not the fault of Zulily. They are not the manufacturer. They buy product from vendors and have faith that their vendors will provide them with a good product. I also read that the delivery time is incredibly long and Zulily oversells items that aren't in stock. The reason the delivery time is long is because Zulily must first wait for their vendors to ship them the merchandise then they ship from their facility. Zulily has a tight schedule and they expect every vendor to adhere to it, but that doesn't always happen. They also DO NOT oversell items. They sell the exact amount of items a vendor tells them is available. Again, Zulily is trusting the vendors they are working with. No business is perfect but Zulily is a great e-commerce site that gets quality products to consumers at an unbeatable price.

I do have some complaints about shipping speed, if you need it asap I wouldnt count on it.  However I called with my concerns about how long my order took (about 2 weeks) to their customer service phone number, where talking to a live person is possible!

VI have read all of these reviews and would like to address certain issues.. 1) complaining about how long it takes for your items to get to your house: when you read "how I works" on their website, it clearly states that they do not have a warehouse. They are ordering from companies who then ship to zulily. Of course it is going to take time. 2) for those of you who are receiving items that are poor quality or do not fit well, it is in your best interest to not be impulsive about purchases. I have filtered through many many pages before I found something I liked, read the size chart, and zoomed in all angles of the picture to see exactly what it looks like. I have purchased two dresses, and three shirts, and am satisfied with every one of my purchases. I would recommend this site to anyone. You just have to understand, and have time for scrutinizing shopping.

The people who are complaining do not either know what a business days, are unable to do basic math or did not take the time to even notice this (don't see how the last is possible since every single page is kind of hard to miss). \u000a\u000a     The other complaint I am reading is that they do not take returns. No, they do not as they state on EVERY SINGLE PAGE. So take the 3 minutes to measure yourself before ordering. Common sense people, you  cannot try it on so take your measurements and compare to the size charts they offer \u2013 duh!

VOK..maybe I got lucky, but Zulily worked beautifully for me.  I ordered before reading the reviews and then held my breath until the order came.  Much to my surprise, every single item came in two weeks.  When I wore the first dress received, 15 co-workers complimented me and one co-worker noted the excellent quality.  \u000a\u000aEverything I got was new, individually sealed in plastic bags, and was as pictured.\u000a\u000aMy only concerns are:\u000a\u000a1. Some of these items can be found elsewhere for similar prices.  I found two of the dresses I bought and some popsicle cake pans on Amazon.  All of these would've shipped free through Amazon prime, and the prices were within three dollars of the Zulily price. \u000a\u000a2. Not being able to return items is a concern, especially since the prices are so similar to other options.  If items aren't as they appear or even if they just don't meet your needs, there's not much you can do.\u000a\u000aThat said, there are quality deals on the site.  $6.00 for shipping is quite reasonable considering the items are coming in two or three different boxes.  As for the delay, I've had cancellations and delays on other sites.  At least you know what you're getting into here.  \u000a\u000aMy feeling is that if you want a variety of stuff with one shipping cost, and don't mind a long wait and possible non-receipt of items, go for Zulily.  You might lose time but you won't lose money.

VI am Glad to see at least a few people informed themselves ahead of time and did not have any false, preconceived notions about delivery times of their products they bought from Zulily.\u000aI personally, have never bought from Zulily yet, (I will though in spite of so many negative remarks in reviews.) But...I NEED to say all this about that. Today, while researching the company, Zulily.com, I studied the site extensively, then ventured into the Zulily reviews on other sites. I found numerous complaints in forum comments and reviews about Zulily. I saw the same complaint over and over; THE SHIPPING WAIT!. So I went back to Zulilys policys and found that it is stated ahead of time quite openly that the shipping delays are something you just have to SOMETIMES live with if you want the very, VERY low prices. Most people, after viewing pretty pictures, only read sizes and buy now buttons, before proceeding with a purchase Online. Then afterwards when things turn out differently than their expectations, based on pre-conceived notions, they occasionally jump into some Online forum or review page and try to avenge themselves single handedly with sulky negative remarks. Sorry, but...as they say, "Look before you Leap." Timing is everything these days, so check the timing on EVERYTHING before you involve yourself, especially ONline.\u000aInstant gratification has become an illness in humanity recently...to the point that some don't bother to read even minimal print on what to expect when purchasing from a new supplier Online then have expectations based on their own perceptions from past experiences. IN a nutshell, the main dissatisfaction appears to be based on the fact that many of these complainers did not look before they leaped. And THAT is mostly what I'm seeing while reading negative reviews about Zulily. \u000aI will buy something from Zulily.com that I am not in a hurry to get, and what I need right now, I will run out right NOW, pay double and get it. This will teach me to think ahead concerning my needs. I think Zulily will continue to flourish and iron out all the many details that are required to make a giant runaway company operate smoothly. Its a great concept and the proof is in the pudding. I read today that Zulily.com went from15,000 members  to 5 million within the same year.  If thats true, then...Move over Mark Z, as in ZU later. Good for you, everyone at Zulily. Go for it and take your own sweet ZULILY TIME. (ironic Zulily?)

They have a sale, they collect orders, after the sale they place a huge order with a company (mostly overseas) and the company ships to Zulily and then Zulily ships the items to you. So, expect to wait a little (average wait is 3 weeks).\u000aI've ordered quite a bit and never had any problems and have been completely satisfied with what I've gotten.\u000aOne time so far a dress I ordered for my daughter wasn't in the package, but they promptly refunded me (too bad because I REALLY wanted the dress) but such is life... There are starving people in this world... and communist dictatorships killing people for nothing-  Not receiving my daughter's dress was hardly cause for an internet riot lol Although the dress was amazing and I'm still kinda sad lol\u000aI'll continue to shop there... in fact, every morning I watch the clock, painfully,  until it hits 9 am... or the second I get an alert on my phone from the Zulily , I drop everything to go check it out.

Just relax, order stuff that sometimes is very unique and hard to get anywhere else and wait. I have been ordering from them a lot, stuff just keeps comming and I am really satisfied so far with the quality of merchandise. I wish the returns were possible, but can live without it. You can always sell the wrong size on ebay and still make money of it if you really have to.

But it clearly states on the site their shipping policies and the amount of time you have to wait before your order ships.\u000aI have twice received items that were not of good quality.  Each time I contacted customer service with a POLITE and detailed email, I heard back within the same business day.  Both times my money was refunded, I received a site credit, AND I was able to keep the items (if I desired to do so.)\u000aGive them a try.  They are a product preview site -- kind of like merchants "testing the waters" to see how well each product will sell.  That's why there is the delay when you make a purchase... Consider it "pre-ordering" something before it hits the market.

One to get reviews and to check the price. Second is that I am carefull which brands I order from. They have some great stuff at really great prices.. But they do have things that you can go to the fabric store and sew your self to. Shop carefully and as far a shipping goes I do not order if I have to have it in the next month. Sometime stuff ships quick sometimes it doesn't. Oh and I have had 2 things that they couldn't get so they gave me my refund and a 10 credit each time. Oh twist my arm. Love this site, don't know what has happen with you guys but mine has been great. \u000aOne last thing if the person that order those nice keen socks that were miss placed in one of box reads this..

VI have never had any issues with Zulily.  On the contrary, I think they're great!!!  \u000a\u000aYou are not ordering from them, you're ordering through them.  They state quite clearly that there are no refunds before you purchase, so you know what you're getting into.   I've bought Crocs for my kids and Croc shirts also.  Items take a week or two to get to Zulily and a week or so from them to you, so yes, it also takes a while, but when you're getting an item at over 50% off retail, it's part of the deal! \u000a\u000aI ordered a really cute pair of Big Buddha boots from them and when they arrived they did not fit me!  My size was correct, but the boots are sized SUPER small.  I called their customer service and they automatically refunded me the money, they added an additional $10 store credit to my account AND I get to keep what they considered faulty merchandize.   I will give the boots to a friend.  \u000a\u000aABOVE AND BEYOND.   I ADORE Zulily and will buy there often.  LOVE THEM!

VI am amazed reading these low reviews.  I have been ordering from this site for a long time.  I know when I place an order it may take up to 6 weeks to receive it.  I have never had a problem with them refunding my money for incorrect sizes.  I have done it several times.  They have been excellent about giving me store credit for being inconvenienced.  \u000a\u000aThe clothes they offer are the most unique and best quality clothes you will find anywhere.  You cannot walk into your local store and find this kind of selection.  I love this website.  I wake up at 9am so I can get what I want before it is sold out.\u000a\u000aJust be patient with them when ordering.  Expect it to take a few weeks.  \u201cDo the math\u201d as a previous poster put it.  If you want exceptional clothing at great prices, you might have to wait for it.  In my opinion it is worth it.

VI use the Zulily app, LOVE IT. I've ordered between 20-30 times now and only1outfit was too small-said size 5 (toddler) but its more like a 3. Everything else I've been thrilled with! Shipping takes a LONG time, I expect 4-5 weeks about. I know I've read companies ship to Zulily then Z ships to customers. I log into account and can see if 'shipped to Zulily' or 'shipped to' me. I've bought shoes that were $120 for $15 (saw same brand online elsewhere for $120!) and every time I wear them ladies stop me to ask about them!! (they are Muluks brand, VERY cool wedges)\u000aAnyway, 2 times something I've ordered has been oversold, Zulily gave me $10 credit instantly! One time it was for a $6 cheer leading hair bow!\u000a (worth $14 online). Very reputable company BUT plan on long shipping times and buy accordingly if you are buying for little ones (this isn't difficult folks). \u000aMy eBay name is heatherj. if you want to make sure I'm a 'normal' person, although one of my 4 children might disagree :).

VI've ordered from Zulily multiple times.  The past two times, there were items in the shipment that were not what I expected size-wise.  Both times, they refunded my money and shipping in Zulily dollars and told me to keep the items.  Although I was disappointed that I didn't get the items I wanted, I was pleased that I didn't have to start with the return shipping.  I thought they were very resonable and responded to my complaints in record time.

VIt seems like a drop in a bucket, and I'm not usually one to write reviews, but I just had to state publicly how satisfied I have been with Zulily.  As with any other "sample sale" site, I knew (and its well documented on the site) that shipping would take longer than such sites as amazon, etc.  However, I still have received all of my orders (of which there have been many) in less time than I expected.  Furthermore, Zulily has one of the best customer service departments that I have ever had the pleasure of working with.  On one occasion, I moved and put a forwarding address in with the post office.  When a Zulily package was attempted to be delivered at the old house, instead of the post office keeping it at the branch for me to pick up, they returned it to Zulily.  I called Zulily who said no problem at all, put a note on my account to send it to the new address when it got back to them, told me how long to expect it to take, and I received the package before their estimated date without having to pay any extra shipping.  On a second occasion, my husband and I ordered a dresser for our son's room from Zulily.  When the dresser arrived, 2 of the parts were slightly damaged (usable but slightly damaged).  I contacted the company that manufactured the dresser who said that they couldn't do anything for me.  I subsequently contacted Zulily who immediately said they would either get me replacement parts from the manufacturere or a complete refund (I indicated that I would prefer replacement parts).  Lo-and-behold less than 1 week later, a box arrived on my doorstep from the manufacturer with the 2 replacement parts in great shape.  Rarely have I ever been so satisfied with a company - they offer great products at low prices with outstanding customer service.  Need I say more?

VI've been using Zulily for a year now. They do take forever, but if you don't have a deadline and don't wait until your child is bursting out of their current clothes then it's fine. They are getting better about shipping honestly. When I first started it took FOREVER, but the past 3-4 months it gets here in 2-3 business weeks which is what their website blatantly says. Every clothes category has an indicated ship out time. The only time they are late is when the clothing company that ships their clothes TO Zulily is late.\u000a\u000aThe actual rough-play quality of the clothes I have never had a problem with. The quality has always been good from what I've ordered. I love Star Ride Kids, Request jeans, and that you can get an outfit for $9.99. And the outfits I have bought (kidzone I think) that were 9.99 were the same quality as Children's Place clothes that my daughter has.\u000a\u000aIt also depends on the brands you get because companies/people ship their stuff to Zulily so quality is based on those individual companies not Zulily as a whole.\u000a\u000aI have never had a problem with customer service. They are always nice to me when I have a question about anything. I have had the product run out on two occasions and they gave me credit back for them which is fine with me because that's where I get my bargains. \u000a\u000aI bought my daughter's summer clothes on Zulily a couple weeks ago and one dress went over the estimated ship time, so they emailed me and told me that it was coming in the next 3-5 business days AND they credited me the amount for the dress because it took so long which to me, in this day and age, is pretty nice. They also give you a panel that says when it is being shipped TO Zulily, when it ships to you, and tracking information so you're not completely left in the dark.\u000a\u000aYes, it is not a ritzy store. Yes, the shipping is longer than, say, Wal-Mart. Yes, you are going to get great deals and good quality (at least I say for all the brands I have bought). Some things aren't good deals, like the boutique clothes (they have sales for high end clothing sometimes)... but that's because I make them so I know $60 for a "boutique" outfit is silly. The customer service was good as far as my experience with them.\u000a\u000aI think as long as you don't have a deadline for the clothes or unrealistic expectations this site will be good for you. This is a great practical site for deals and I have been disappointed that good business is not practiced anymore (stores telling you to shove it if their product is no good or not crediting you anything) and this site has always gone beyond normal sites/stores to satisfy people, at least with everyone I have talked to that uses it. I have always heard they will, in fact, take returns if it is damaged or a wrong size. I'm not sure about other peoples' experiences, but these are mine. I'm not sure if my expectations or budget is just not high enough to be irritated about decent quality with $10 outfits. I mean I'm not expecting $50 quality for a $10 outfit, but I can say that the $7-$10 outfits I have bought for my daughter go through a lot of rough play and stand up amazing to it.\u000a\u000aTheir shipping cost is always $7.95, which is pretty good for small orders and amazing for very large orders. \u000a\u000aI don't buy the 'ship by a certain date' clothes for a certain date because I will NOT buy clothes on this site for a specific event. Certain sites have certain quirks and if you want to shop savvy online you have to learn them and decide if you want to use the site or not. I don't buy anything for an event or occasion with a deadline because I don't want to set myself up that way. Setting myself up for failure is not a tendency of mine ;) The site is what it is. I've never had a problem with them.

VI ordered 4 pairs of Crocs shoes for my kids and I, at a great price, and 3 adorable outfits for my daughter.  I placed the orders with no rush March 27 and did not get charged until the order was being shipped.  I got email notifications of my order and shipment.  Both orders arrived together in 1 box, which was great, yesterday April 18.  All items were packed properly with tags and in superb condition.  One of the crocs I ordered was a size smaller.  I checked my order online and saw that the size I received was the one in the order but I still called them to see if they could exchange it for the size I needed.  I called today and spoke to Jenny, a customer service representative.  She was warm and friendly and proceeded to check my order.  She made it very easy; gave me a refund for the item, placed a new order for the correct size of the shoes and asked me to keep the pair I had and donate it to a charity or someone in need. I have never heard of any other retailer doing this, which in my opinion speaks volumes!  I was hesitant ordering after reading all of the bad reviews but it seems that they have listened and attempted to correct any issues.  I will order from Zulily again!

VAwesome!! Just have to say I have never had any issues with this site. I actually was googling Totsy reviews because I have nothing but trouble with them and decided to google Zullily's reviews to see the difference. Very shocked with all the bad reviews, but then again Zullily appears to be a much larger company. Since everyone knows the only people who write reviews are the people who are angry I decided to write a nice one, I have ordered about 10 times and the shipping takes 7-14 days but I have always received all my items and VERY happy! Anyway if you have never ordered from this site I suggest you try it, well worth your money. If you plan on buying a gift, though, buy it in advance! Once again VERY HAPPY customer!

VSaw a sale, bought the product, received the product within Zulily's stated timeframe. What's not to like? I saved over 75% on the normal retail price and the product was exactly as ordered and in perfect, new condition.\u000a\u000aI will definitely use Zulily again.\u000a\u000aIf you have questions about shipping times please see my post in the Q&A section for Zulily.

VI have been shopping at Zulily since June 2011. Since then I have placed 20 orders so far. I mostly shop for my 4 & 1/2 yr old daughter (clothes, shoes, books, toys). Out of all the orders placed so far, Zulily cancelled only one for unavailability. But then they made up for it by offering me a $ 10 store credit. One of my recent orders was for a handbag, They sent me a wrong style. I complained via email. They responded promptly by refunding the full price of the bag. Plus they offered me a $ 10 store credit by way of an apology & also let me keep / donate the bag that I'd received. All the stuff I ordered so far were all excellent quality. No regrets at all. I found them very professional in their customer service. I do wish though the shipping was faster. But I guess thats how it works for flash sales sites. I just plan ahead & order a size up. I do not order stuff I may need soon. I will continue to shop at Zulily & also recommend this site to my friends.

VIt's a good thing I didn't read the reviews before I placed my order or I would not have ordered from Zulily.  My first order was 2 pair of Aerosole shoes and my 2nd order was a coat.  Loved both items, all were true to size.  It states on the page that it takes 10 to 14 days to ship.  So I really wasn't expecting the orders for about 3 to 4 weeks.  Going in with that mind set, I wasn't disappointed.

VI love this site!!! Read terms and conditions regarding shipping. With this in mind I only order bigger sizes for my baby. I've made multiple orders with them & I am pleased. I've also had concerns and customer service responded with all my concerns addressed.

VI have ordered twice. The first was a Thomas the Train wooden set. It came with 6 engine pieces and 1 of them played music. It also came with a nice wooden box we can use for storage. Comparing to Walmart, it was about $65 of train pieces for $28. Awesome!\u000a\u000aThe second time I ordered, I was able to cash in one of my $15 referral credits towards 3 pairs of jeans. They arrived in less than 3 weeks. I paid $11 for each pair.\u000a\u000aShipping is slow. You just have to plan ahead. The jeans I bought were for next year, I buy everything in advance for the best deals. If you don't get all torked up about the shipping time, you can snag a great deal.

VI am 110% addicted to Zulily.  I am astonished to hear all these ladies complaining about how they can't have rock bottom prices AND 2 day shipping.  I believe it clearly says somewhere on the website that shipping takes awhile.  Doesn't anyone realize thats one of the ways to keep their prices low???  I have nooooo problem waiting 2-3-4 weeks for something I saved 75% on,,,no problem at all.  It kind of sounds like all the people that are having problems with this site should probably stick to shopping at the mall (yuck) or Amazon.  You can't have it all,,,,the fabulous deal, speedy shipping.  I don't shop at any other places anymore except Zulily and others like it. Keep up the good work Zulily!!!  Me and my babies would be lost without you.....

VVery Very happy with my purchase! It took longer than expected only because I didn't take into consideration that it says 10-14 BUSINESS days, not just 10-14 days. I absolutely love what I bought and think I got a great deal. Would definetly buy from them again!!! Great quality of products!
